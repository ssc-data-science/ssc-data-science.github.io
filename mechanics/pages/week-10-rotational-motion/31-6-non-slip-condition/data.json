A typical example is when different objects are connected by ropes or ropes passing through pulleys.\nBelow we discuss the constraint imposed by a rope wrapped around a massive pulley of radius \\(R \\) and connected to a hanging block. The resulting rotation of the pulley is related to the translation of the block because we will assume:\nNon-slip condition: the rope does not slip relative to the pulley. Ideal Rope: massless rope with constant length. Consider the three points A, B and C in the rope. At time \\(t\\), left figure, point A is in contact with the pulley and at an angle \\(\\theta\\) with respect to the horizontal, point B is the point where the rope detaches from the pulley, and point C is the point in the rope in contact with the block. The length of the portion of the rope between points A and B is the arlclength \\(s\\), where \\(s = R\\theta \\).\nIf the rope does not slip relative to the pulley, point A must have the same velocity as a point at the rim of the pulley. At time \\(t+\\Delta t\\) , left figure, the pulley has rotated an angle \\(\\theta\\) and point A has moved an arc of length \\(s\\) at the same rate as a point at the rim. The velocity of point A is has a component tangent to the circle given by \\(\\displaystyle v_A = \\frac{ds}{dt}= R\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\).\nAt the same time, because the rope has a constant length (ideal rope), when the pulley has rotated an angle \\(\\theta\\) the string has unwrapped a length \\(s\\) (right figure). Consequently, points B and C and all the points in the hanging rope have moved down a length \\(s\\). As a result, the velocity of any point in the hanging rope is the same as the one of the block equal to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{ds}{dt} \\).\nIn this problem, assumptions 1 and 2, imply that the component of the velocity of the block is:\n\\(\\displaystyle v = \\frac{ds}{dt}=R\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\)\nAfter taking the derivative with respect to time, the acceleration of the block is equal the tangential component of the acceleration of a point at the rim of the pulley:\n\\(\\displaystyle a = R \\alpha\\)\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
