  "title":"PS.1.2 Shooting the Apple",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nAn apple is suspended a height \\(\\displaystyle h \\) above the ground. A physics demo instructor has set up a projectile gun a horizontal distance \\(\\displaystyle d \\) away from the apple. The projectile is initially a height \\(\\displaystyle s \\) above the ground. The demo instructor fires the projectile with an initial velocity of magnitude \\(\\displaystyle v_0 \\) just as the apple is released. Find \\(\\displaystyle \\theta _0 \\), the angle at which the projectile gun must be aimed in order for the projectile to strike the apple. Ignore air resistance.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
