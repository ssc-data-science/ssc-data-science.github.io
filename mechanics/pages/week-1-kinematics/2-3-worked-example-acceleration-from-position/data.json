  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA runner travels along the x-axis, and at time \\(\\displaystyle t=0 \\) is at the origin. The \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner\u0026rsquo;s position with respect to the origin is given by:\n\\(\\displaystyle x(t)=bt^2 \\)\nwhere \\(\\displaystyle b \\) is a positive constant.\n(Part a) What are the units of the constant \\(\\displaystyle b \\)? Express your answer in terms of m for meter and s for seconds.\n(Part b) Find \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\), the \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner\u0026rsquo;s velocity as a function of time.\n(Part c) Find \\(\\displaystyle a(t) \\), the \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner\u0026rsquo;s acceleration as a function of time.\n(Part d) Do a plot of \\(\\displaystyle x(t) \\), \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\) and \\(\\displaystyle a(t) \\) vs. time.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
