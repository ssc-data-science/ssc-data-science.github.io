  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA particle of mass \\(\\displaystyle m \\) is moving along the +\\(\\displaystyle x \\)-axis with a constant speed \\(\\displaystyle v_0 \\). At time \\(\\displaystyle t = 0 \\) it enters a region in space between two parallel plates which are separated by a distance \\(\\displaystyle h \\) and are contained in the \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-\\(\\displaystyle z \\) plane. The figure shows a side view of the plates, the +\\(\\displaystyle z \\) axis is out of the screen. While the particle is between the plates, it is acted on by both gravity and by a time varying force that points upward (along the +\\(\\displaystyle y \\)-direction) and has magnitude \\(\\displaystyle F = bt \\), where \\(\\displaystyle b \\) is a positive constant that is sufficiently large such that the particle hits the top plate without ever touching the bottom plate.\n(Part 1) What are the units of the constant \\(\\displaystyle b \\)? Enter m for meters, s for seconds and kg for kilograms. Make a sketch of what you think the trajectory of the particle is as it moves through the plates. Draw a coordinate system showing the position of the particle at time \\(\\displaystyle t \\). Clearly indicate your origin, choice of axis, and draw in the coordinate functions for the position of the particle at time \\(\\displaystyle t \\)?\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
