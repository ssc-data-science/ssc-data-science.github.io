  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nThe center of two spherical planets of masses \\(\\displaystyle m_1 \\) and \\(\\displaystyle m_2 \\) are separated by a distance \\(\\displaystyle d \\). Consider the origin of the coordinate system to be at the center of planet 1. At what location \\(\\displaystyle x \\) measured from the center of planet 1 will a third planet of mass \\(\\displaystyle m \\) experience zero gravitational force? Assume \\(\\displaystyle m_1 \\ne m_2 \\).\nExpress your answer in terms of the gravitational constant \\(\\displaystyle G \\), \\(\\displaystyle m_1 \\), \\(\\displaystyle m_2 \\) and \\(\\displaystyle d \\) as needed.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
