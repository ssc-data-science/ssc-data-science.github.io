  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSnow of density \\(\\displaystyle \\rho\\) covers a road to a uniform depth of \\(\\displaystyle D\\) meters. A snowplowing truck of mass \\(\\displaystyle M\\) starts clearing the road at \\(\\displaystyle t = 0\\) at an initial velocity \\(\\displaystyle v_0\\). The contact between the tires and the road applies a constant force \\(\\displaystyle F_0\\) in the forward direction. The truck\u0026rsquo;s subsequent velocity depends on time as it clears a path of width \\(\\displaystyle W\\) through the snow. The snow, after coming momentarily to rest relative to the truck, is ejected sideways, perpendicular to the truck.\n(Part a) Find a differential equation relating the change in the velocity of the truck \\(\\displaystyle dv/dt\\) to its velocity \\(\\displaystyle v(t)\\). Express you answer in terms of some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle \\rho\\), \\(\\displaystyle D\\), \\(\\displaystyle W\\), \\(\\displaystyle M\\), \\(\\displaystyle v\\) and \\(\\displaystyle F_0\\).\n(Part b) Calculate \\(\\displaystyle v_{\\text {term}}\\), the terminal speed reached by the truck. Express you answer in terms of some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle \\rho\\), \\(\\displaystyle D\\), \\(\\displaystyle W\\), \\(\\displaystyle M\\) and \\(\\displaystyle F_0\\).\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
