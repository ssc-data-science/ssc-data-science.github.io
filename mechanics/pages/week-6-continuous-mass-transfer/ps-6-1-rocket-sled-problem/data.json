  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA rocket sled can eject gas backwards or forwards at a speed \\(\\displaystyle u\\) relative to the sled. The initial mass of the fuel in the sled is equal to dry mass of the sled, \\(\\displaystyle m_0\\). At \\(\\displaystyle t=0\\) the rocket sled has speed \\(\\displaystyle v_0\\) and starts to eject fuel in the forward direction in order to slow down. You may ignore air resistance. You may treat \\(\\displaystyle u\\) as a given constant in the following questions.\n(Part a) Let \\(\\displaystyle v_ r(t)\\) be the x-component of the rocket sled velocity, and \\(\\displaystyle m_ r(t)\\) the mass of the rocket, dry mass and the fuel inside the rocket, at a given time \\(\\displaystyle t\\). Derive differential equation for \\(\\displaystyle v_ r\\) in terms of \\(\\displaystyle m_ r\\).\n(Part b) Integrate the equation you derived for \\(\\displaystyle v_ r\\) to find the velocity of the rocket sled as a function of mass, \\(\\displaystyle v_ r(m_ r)\\), as the rocket sled slows down. Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle u\\), \\(\\displaystyle v_0\\),\\(\\displaystyle m_0\\), and \\(\\displaystyle m_ r\\).\n(Part c) What was the initial speed \\(\\displaystyle v_0\\) of the rocket sled if the sled came to rest just as all the fuel was burned? Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle u\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_0\\), and \\(\\displaystyle m_ r\\).\nRocket Sled - Differential Equation Viewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript Rocket Sled - Integrate the Rocket Equation Viewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript Rocket Sled - Solve for Initial Velocity Viewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
