  "title":"11.2 Worked Example - Car on a Banked Turn",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA car of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\\) is turning on a banked curve of angle \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\) with respect to the horizontal. The curve is icy and friction between the tires and the surface is negligible. The curve has a radius \\(\\displaystyle r\\). What is the speed \\(\\displaystyle v\\) at which the car can turn safely? Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle g\\), \\(\\displaystyle r\\), and \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\).\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
