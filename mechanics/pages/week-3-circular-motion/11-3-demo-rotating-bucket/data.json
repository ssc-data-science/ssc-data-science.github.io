  "title":"11.3 Demo: Rotating Bucket",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nIn this demo, a bucket full of ping pong balls is rotated vertically fast enough so that the balls stay in the bucket. Slowing down below a certain speed, or simply holding the bucket upside down will cause the balls to fall. This can be explained using Newton\u0026rsquo;s second law and the physics of circular motion.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video « Previous | Next »\n"}
