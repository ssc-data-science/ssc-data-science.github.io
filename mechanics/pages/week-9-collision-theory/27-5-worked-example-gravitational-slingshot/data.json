  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA spacecraft of mass \\(m1\\) with speed \\(v_{1i} = 3v_s\\), approaches Saturn which is moving in the opposite direction with speed \\(v_s\\). After interacting gravitationally with Saturn, the spacecraft swings around Saturn and heads off in the opposite direction from its approach direction. The mass of Saturn is \\(m_s\\), is much much larger than the mass of the spacecraft. Find the final speed, \\(v_{1f}\\), of the spacecraft after it is far enough away from Saturn to be nearly free of the gravitational pull of Saturn.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
