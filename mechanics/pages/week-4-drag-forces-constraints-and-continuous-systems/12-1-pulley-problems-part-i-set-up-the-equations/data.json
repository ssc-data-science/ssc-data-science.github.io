  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nIn the figure, pulley A is fixed to the ceiling. An ideal rope is attached at one end to block 1 of mass \\(m_1\\), it passes around a second pulley, labelled B, and its other end is fixed to the ceiling. A second ideal rope attaches pulley B to a second block of mass \\(m_2\\). As a result, pulley B and block 2 move together.\nThe goal of the problem is to calculate the accelerations of blocks 1 and 2.\nThe solution of this problem is divided into four parts:\nPart I : Set up the system of equations. Part II: Constraint condition - find the relationship between the accelerations. Part III: Constraint condition using a virtual displacement argument. Part IV: Solving the system of equations. The video below will help you to set up the equations needed to answer the question.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
