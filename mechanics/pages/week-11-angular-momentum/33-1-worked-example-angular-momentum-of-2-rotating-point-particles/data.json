  "title":"33.1 Worked Example - Angular Momentum of 2 Rotating Point Particles",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nTwo identical particles of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\\) move in a circle of radius \\(\\displaystyle R\\), \\(\\displaystyle 180^ o\\) out of phase, at an angular velocity \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{\\omega } = \\omega _ z\\hat{k}\\) in a plane parallel to but a distance \\(\\displaystyle h\\) above the x-y plane. Treat the two particles as a system.\nCalculate \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{L}_ S\\), the angular momentum of the system about point \\(\\displaystyle S\\). Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle m\\), \\(\\displaystyle R\\), \\(\\displaystyle h\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\omega _ z\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{k}\\), and \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{r}\\) as needed.\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
