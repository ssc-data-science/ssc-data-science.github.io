  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nTwo identical particles form a system. At the instant shown in the figure the particles have equal and opposite momentums: \\(\\displaystyle p_2=- p_1=p\\).\n(Part a) Determine a vector expression for the angular momentum of the system about the point A.\n(Part b) Determine a vector expression for the angular momentum of the system about the point B.\n(Part c) How do your results for angular momentum about A and B compare?\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
