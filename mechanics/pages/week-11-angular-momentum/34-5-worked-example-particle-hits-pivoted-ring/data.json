  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA rigid ring of radius \\(\\displaystyle R\\) and mass \\(\\displaystyle m_1\\) is lying on a horizontal frictionless table and pivoted at the point \\(\\displaystyle P\\). The figure is an overhead view, gravity points into the screen. A point-like object of mass \\(\\displaystyle m_2\\) is moving to the right with speed \\(\\displaystyle v_ i\\). It collides and sticks to the ring at point \\(\\displaystyle A\\) on the ring as shown in the figure. After the collision, the particle sticks to the ring and both objects rotate together counterclockwise about the pivot point. The angular velocity is pointing out of the page with magnitude \\(\\displaystyle \\omega _ f\\).\nThe goal of this problem is to find \\(\\displaystyle \\omega _ f\\), the magnitude of the angular velocity of the ring-particle system after the collision.\n(Part a) Consider the ring and the object as the system and the time interval that the collision lasts. Which of the following statements is true during the collision?\nThe momentum is constant. The angular momentum about the pivot is constant. The mechanical energy is constant. (Part b) What is \\(\\displaystyle I_{P}^{system}\\), the moment of inertia of the system of the ring with the point object stuck to it at point A, calculated about an axis passing through the pivot point \\(\\displaystyle P\\) and perpendicular to the plane of the ring? Write your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle m_1\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_2\\), and \\(\\displaystyle R\\).\n(Part c) Calculate the angular momentum about the pivot point \\(\\displaystyle P\\) of the ring-particle system at the instants immediately before and after the collision. For direction, assume that \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{i}\\) points to the right, \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{j}\\) points up, and \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{k}\\) points out of the page. Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle R\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_1\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle v_ i\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\omega _ f\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\hat i\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\hat j\\), and \\(\\displaystyle \\hat k\\).\n(Part d) Determine an expression for \\(\\displaystyle \\omega _ f\\), the angular speed of the system immediately after the collision. Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle R\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_1\\), \\(\\displaystyle m_2\\) and \\(\\displaystyle v_ i\\)\nViewing videos requires an internet connection View video page Download video Download transcript « Previous | Next »\n"}
