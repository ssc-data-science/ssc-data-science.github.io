1
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:05,090
Now that we have all
the pieces in place,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,460
we'd like to apply the momentum
principle to the rocket

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,310
problem.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,490
Recall that the
momentum principle

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,360
is that the external
force on the rocket

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,510
causes-- on the system-- causes
the momentum of the system

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,690
to change.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,460
And the fundamental
definition of a derivative

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,720
is to look at the change in
momentum between sometimes t

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,030
plus delta t-- our two states
that we've identified--

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,210
divided by delta t.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,390
Now recall that we had
the momentum of the system

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,270
at time t was the mass
of the rocket times

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,730
d-bar of the rocket a t.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:54,530
I'll just quickly show
mass of the rocket V-rt.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:02,750
And we had the system
at time t plus delta t

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,660
where we had delta M-fuel equals
minus delta M-rocket Here we

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,680
had M-r plus delta M. And we
had the velocity in the ground

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,350
frame, which we saw
was equal to-- so let's

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,150
write out the momentum of the
system at time t plus delta t.

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,420
That was a little bit longer.

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,070
p system at t plus
delta t had two pieces.

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:42,050
It had M-r plus delta M-r
times V of r of t plus delta t.

24
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,670
And we were subtracting--
now, because we

25
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,270
made this change, that's
minus then delta M-r u

26
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,580
plus V-bar of t plus delta t.

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,590
And this, recall, was
the velocity of the fuel.

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,880
Now we're in position to
apply our momentum principle,

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,950
because we have expressions
for the momentum

30
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,150
of the system at
time t and at time t

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,160
and at time t plus delta t.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,980
So now this will be
a big expression.

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,120
So we'll write external force is
the limit as delta t goes to 0.

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,230
Now here, our first term, is
of M of r plus delta M-r times

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,960
the velocity of the rocket
at time t plus delta t.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,440
And now we have the fuel
term, minus delta M-r times u

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,020
plus V of r of t plus delta t.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,400
And we have to
subtract from that

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
and I'll indicate that with
a slightly different color.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,590
M-r V of r of t.

41
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,860
And the whole thing,
we're dividing by delta t.

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,810
Now let's look at
this expression

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,510
first because there is some
very nice simplifications.

44
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,260
The first thing we can see,
let's look at this term delta

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,010
M-r times V of r.

46
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,520
Notice we have minus
delta M-r V of r here.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,790
So those two terms cancel.

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,430
And we're just left
with three other terms

49
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,360
and let's write them out.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,210
So now we have the limit
as delta t goes to 0.

51
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,920
And I'm going to combine
terms in the following way.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,750
M-r times V of r
of t plus delta t.

53
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,630
And over here, I have
M-r minus V of r.

54
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:50,090
So I have a minus V of r
of t divided by delta t.

55
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,520
And now I have one
more term here.

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,160
And I'm going to write this as
minus the limit as delta t goes

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,120
to 0 of delta M-r over delta t.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
Remember, this term cancelled.

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,890
We only have u, the speed of
the fuel relative to the rocket.

60
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,030
And in both cases--
this is our first term

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,450
and here's our second term.

62
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,260
Let's look at these limits.

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,950
Notice in here,
we're just taking

64
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,930
V of r of t plus delta t minus
V of r-t divided by delta t.

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,650
And that's precisely the
definition of the derivative

66
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,540
of the velocity of the rocket.

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,030
So this first term,
our expression

68
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,620
becomes the external
force is equal to the mass

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,820
of our system times V
of r, the derivative

70
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,100
of the velocity of the rocket.

71
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,800
And the second term,
this is the rate

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,180
that the fuel is
changing in the rocket.

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,010
This is rather the rate that the
mass of the rocket is changing.

74
00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:00,350
So that's the derivative dM-r
dt times the relative velocity

75
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,540
of the fuel with
respect to the rocket.

76
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,710
So this equation here--
I'll box it off--

77
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,810
is called the rocket
equation, which

78
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,100
we've derived from
the momentum principle

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,580
using our momentum diagrams.

80
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,030
And you can see that this
is what people refer to

81
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,660
as rocket science.
