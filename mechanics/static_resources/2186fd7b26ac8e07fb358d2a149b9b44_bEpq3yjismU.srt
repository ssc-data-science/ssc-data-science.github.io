1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,220
Let's consider a
ball that is dropped

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,160
from a certain height, h i,
above the ground and this ball

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,500
is falling.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,250
It hits the ground
and it bounces up

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,310
until it reaches some
final height, h final.

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,390
Now when the ball is
colliding with the ground,

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,820
there are collision forces.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,660
And in this problem
what we like to do

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,840
is figure out what the
average force of the ground

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,315
is on the ball.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,790
And that will be
the normal force,

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,120
the average normal force, on
the ball during the collision.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,450
Now if we look at
this ball dropping,

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,020
it's going to lose a
little bit of energy,

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,460
because it's getting
compressed at the collision.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,180
Let's look at an example of
the actual ball dropping.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,390
As you can see in
this high speed video,

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,830
as the ball falls down, it
collides with the ground.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,860
When it collides with the
ground, it's compressed.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,230
And then as it rebounds
upwards, the ball

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,490
expands back to
its original shape,

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,450
but it doesn't quite get
to the same height-- that's

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,010
because when the
ball is compressed,

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,380
there's some deformation in the
rubber structure of the ball,

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,670
and it's not a completely
elastic deformation.

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,610
And so some of the energy
is transformed into, first,

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,420
molecular motions, which turn
into thermal energy that's

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,740
radiative into the environment.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,960
Let's look in particular at
the details of the collision.

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,750
If we look at it in slow
motion what we have here--

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,350
and I'll draw a picture--
as the ball is colliding

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,070
with the ground,
ball compresses,

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,100
expands as it goes upwards.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,000
And so we can draw a free
body diagram of the ball

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,070
with a normal force and
a gravitational force.

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,430
Now let's choose our
positive direction up.

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,900
So now what we'd like to do is
apply the momentum principle

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,540
to analyze the
average normal force.

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,889
And our momentum principle,
remember is impulse.

40
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,760
The force integrated over
some time during the collision

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,620
is equal to the
change in momentum.

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,110
So what we'd like
to do is identify

43
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,120
the states that are relevant.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,250
So it will have a state
before, so what we'll do

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,370
is we'll call this
the before state,

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,240
and that's right before the
ball is hitting the ground.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:42,160
And we have an after state,
and in the after state,

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,040
the ball has now finished
colliding with the ground,

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,480
and it's now moving
up with speed up.

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,490
Now again, we're going
to choose a positive up.

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,180
Here on representing
things as it speeds.

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,950
One of the things, we
need some times here,

53
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:07,050
so let's say that t initial is
zero, this is our final time.

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,550
We'll call this time
the before time,

55
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,050
we'll just call this t
before, and this is t after.

56
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,690
And then our integral
is going from before to

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,950
after the momentum.

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,370
And we can now apply
the momentum principle.

59
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,930
Well, this is a vector equation
and we've chosen unit vectors

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,300
up, so what we have
here is the integral

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:40,250
of from t before to t after of
N minus mg, integrated over dt,

62
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,220
and that's equal to
the momentum at the y

63
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,040
component of the
momentum at t after,

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,061
minus the y component
of the momentum.

65
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,560
We don't have a
vector here anymore.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,329
The y component of
the vector, t before.

67
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,130
And so this is our expression
of the momentum principle.

68
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,570
Impulse causes
momentum to change.

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,380
Now we're assuming that the
normal force just averaging it

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,460
and so this intregral simply
becomes N average minus

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,320
ng, times the time of collision,
is equal to-- now in here

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,820
we can put the mass of the
ball, we have the velocity.

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,650
Now here's where we
have to be a little bit

74
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,160
careful, because we're
looking at the y component.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,660
We chose speed downwards, that's
in the negative y direction,

76
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,270
so we have minus-- sorry,
we're looking at after.

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,680
We have plus V after, because
this is going in the positive j

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,500
direction.

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,920
And over here we
have a negative mass,

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,140
but it's going in
the minus direction,

81
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,540
so we have a minus
mV before, and so we

82
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,170
get mass times V
after plus V before.

83
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:06,610
So our first result is that
the normal force average.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,720
Let's bring the divide
through by delta t,

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,600
and bring the Ng term over,
so we have m Va plus Vb,

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,230
divided by delta t, plus mg.

87
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,130
So we see that if the
collision time is very short,

88
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,220
then this average force
is a little bit bigger.

89
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,910
A long collision time,
the average force

90
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,940
a little bit smaller.

91
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,530
Now from kinematics, we already
have worked out the problem

92
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,960
that the speed
for an object that

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,220
rises to a height, h final,
this is the velocity afterwards,

94
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,790
is just square
root of 2g h final.

95
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,500
And in a similar way, if an
object is falling height h i,

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,140
the speed when it gets
to the bottom is 2ghi.

97
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,640
And so now we can conclude
with these substitutions

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,780
that the average force equals
m times square root of 2g h

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,460
final, plus the square
root of 2g h initial,

100
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,970
over the collision
time, plus and mg.

101
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,580
And of course the
collision time,

102
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,750
we're saying is t
after minus t before.

103
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,580
And so that's how we can
use the momentum principle

104
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,430
to get an average expression
for the normal force.
