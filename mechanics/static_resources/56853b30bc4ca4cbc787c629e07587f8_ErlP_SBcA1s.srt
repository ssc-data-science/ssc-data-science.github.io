1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,120
We will now like to begin
our analysis of motion.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,960
And we'll start with
one dimensional motion.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,060
Let's just consider a
person running along a road.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,780
And so here's our runner,
and here's our road.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,760
And what we want to do
is be able to describe

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,710
the position, the velocity, the
acceleration of this runner.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,140
In order to do that, we need
our first mathematical tool,

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,680
which is a coordinate system.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,160
What is a coordinate system?

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,650
Well, the first thing that we
want to choose is an origin.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,530
We can pick the origin
anywhere we want.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,940
That's a degree of freedom.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,970
So let's choose a point
along our road as our origin.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,520
The next thing to do
is to choose an axis.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Well, the road is
naturally defining

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,080
an axis for our problem.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,650
And so we'll call
this the x-axis.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,790
Now, along with
that axis, we want

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,170
to divide that up into
some type of units

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,730
so we might divide
our axis like this.

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,480
And what's important
here is to introduce

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,160
a positive coordinate direction.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,100
And so the way I'll do that,
is I'll call this the plus x,

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,550
and on this side of the
origin x is negative.

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,300
Now, the third most
important thing

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,560
is that we're going to talk
about vectors and physics.

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,934
So we want a choice
of unit vector.

28
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:31,850
Now, because it's only
one dimensional motion,

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,770
we only need one unit vector.

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,200
So what that means is a choice
of unit vector at every point.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,570
Let's just consider
a point here, P1.

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,050
So our unit vector
I'll call it i hat 1.

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, let's pick
another point here.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,070
We'll call this the point P2.

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,039
And over here we'll choose
a unit vector, i hat 2.

36
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:59,250
So every single point in
space has a unit vector.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,510
Now, what's unique
about this one

38
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,230
dimensional linear
Cartesian coordinate

39
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,780
system is the following,
these unit vectors

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,990
have the same magnitude--
a unit vector by definition

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,050
has magnitude 1-- and they're
pointing in the same direction.

42
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,720
So if two vectors have
the same magnitude

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,010
and point in the same
direction, they are equal.

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,930
So what makes this
coordinate system unique,

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,470
this Cartesian
coordinate system,

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,180
that every single point,
no matter where we are,

47
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,680
the unit vectors point
in the positive direction

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,910
because they have the same
magnitude and direction.

49
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,700
All of these unit
vectors are equal.

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
And we call that i hat.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
So symbolically, we
may draw a picture

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,180
and indicate our unit vector
in the positive x direction.

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,680
And this is our
coordinate system.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,720
And we can next
begin to describe

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,070
the position and the
velocity of our object

56
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,324
as it's moving along
this x direction.
