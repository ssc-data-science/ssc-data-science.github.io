00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,777
Welcome to Physics 8.01,
MITs introductory course

2
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:08,029
in classical mechanics for
first year undergraduates.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,350
Im Deepto Chakrabarty.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,200
And Im Peter Dourmashkin.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
Were the faculty members
in charge of this course.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,840
The science of
classical mechanics

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,410
establishes an important
principle of cause and effect,

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,021
wherein the changes
in a bodys motion

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,640
arise from the application
of physical forces.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,995
Newtons Laws of
Motion established

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:29,290
the scientific principle of
analyzing observed phenomenon

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,970
through the use of clearly
articulated mathematical models

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,820
rather than through intuition.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,304
These concepts are so important
to the modern branches

15
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,969
of science and
engineering that we

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,769
require all of our
undergraduates at MIT

17
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:44,985
to take classical mechanics
regardless of whatever course

18
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:47,020
they intend to specialize in.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,987
In many high school
level physics courses,

20
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:51,235
mechanics is taught
as a set of formulas

21
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:55,739
to memorize for a series
of standard situations.

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:56,910
Our course is different.

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,592
Here, you will learn a set
of fundamental principles

24
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,368
that you can use to apply
to unfamiliar situations

25
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:05,084
and analyze them rather
than just situations

26
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,640
that you studied previously.

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,810
8.01 assumes a strong background
in high school level physics

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,649
and mathematics.

29
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:14,779
We introduce and make extensive
use of calculus as needed,

30
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:18,070
so a previous course in
calculus is not a prerequisite.

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,718
However, it is a rigorous
and technically challenging

32
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:24,010
course aimed at
MIT undergraduates.

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,376
8.01s OpenCourseWare site
contains a coherent set

34
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:30,094
of lessons that will take you
through all the basic concepts

35
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:33,790
of classical mechanics as well
as a set of advanced topics

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,030
including mass flow,
simple harmonic motion,

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,770
and precessional motion.

38
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,611
In each of these
lessons, you will

39
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:42,452
find a series of short
lightboard videos

40
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,545
that will help you
understand concepts,

41
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:49,380
mathematical derivations, and
problems solving techniques.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,503
In addition, you will find
many other useful resources

43
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,839
including an online textbook,
many worked example problems,

44
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,509
and MIT level problem sets.

45
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,619
Developing a
command of mechanics

46
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,995
is a powerful tool for
understanding the world

47
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:04,849
around us.

48
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,699
Welcome to 8.01.
