1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:02,130
There's an important
distinction to make

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,170
between cause and
effect when analyzing

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,830
the motion of objects.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,110
There are two very separate
questions that we can ask.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,670
The first is, how does a
particular object move?

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,140
This is a purely descriptive
geometrical question

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,520
that we're asking.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,290
What does the geometry
of the motion look like?

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,750
If we were to draw
its trajectory

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,630
as a function of time, what's
the shape of that trajectory?

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,510
The study of the geometry
of motion of a trajectory

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,380
is referred to as kinematics.

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,200
The second question we can
ask is, why does an object

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,320
move the way it does?

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,950
Why does the kinematic
description of the trajectory

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,690
look the way it does?

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,280
This concerns what the
causes are of the motion

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,700
and of the changes
in that motion.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,040
The study of the cause
behind the changes of motion

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,020
is called dynamics.

21
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,120
Newton's Second Law of Motion
connects these two questions.

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,940
When we write F equals
ma, this is more than just

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,840
a mathematical identity.

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,090
Physically, we're connecting
two very different questions.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,400
And we can symbolize that
by dividing the equation

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
into its two sides.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,220
The right-hand
side, the ma side,

28
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,990
is essentially asking
the question of how, how

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,560
does the object move?

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,710
What does that motion look like?

31
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,680
It's a description, a
geometric description

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,970
of the object's motion.

33
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,060
The left-hand side of the
equation, where the forces are,

34
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,880
answers the question of
why, why does the object

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,340
move the way it does?

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,289
What causes the
motion to change?

37
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,500
These are very
different conceptually.

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,280
And the remarkable thing about
Newton's Second Law, in fact,

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,170
one of Newton's
signature accomplishments

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,789
was to realize that
these two questions can

41
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:44,080
be connected in this way through
Newton's Second Law of Motion.

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,570
Since these are very
different issues,

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,350
we'll examine them
separately in our course.

44
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,410
We'll begin this week by looking
at kinematics in one and two

45
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,630
dimensions, basically
learning how

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,340
to describe the geometric
motion of an object

47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,620
and its trajectory.

48
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,600
We'll follow that by discussing
the dynamics of the motion,

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,740
examining why an object's motion
changes when forces are applied

50
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,059
through a discussion of Newton's
laws and their applications.
