1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,480
We will now introduce a
new kinematic quantity

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,260
called angular momentum.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,960
Angular momentum
will be very useful

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,910
when we describe the
rotation and objects.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,250
In particular, how will
it be related to torque.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,110
Now, what is angular momentum?

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,740
Suppose we have an
object of mass m.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,380
And it's moving
in this direction.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,140
And it has momentum p.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,510
Remember, p equals mv.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,770
Angular momentum is always
defined about some point.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,310
So suppose we choose a
point s, and I wanted

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,020
to find the angular
momentum about

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,180
s due to this motion
of the object.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,920
And the way it's defined is I'll
draw a vector from the point

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,410
s to where the object is.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,320
And our definition of angular
momentum about s is equal--

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,690
this is three lines
for our definition--

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,950
it's the vector cross
product of the vector rs.

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,650
We have the vector p.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,890
Now, how do we define the
direction of this vector?

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,400
Well, the way we do
that for any vector

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,860
product is we take
the two vectors

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,820
and we put them tail to tail.

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,080
So let's start off
by drawing the vector

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,560
rs in that direction.

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,070
And now when you
take a cross product,

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,160
we draw an arrow from the
first vector to the second one.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,400
Remember, cross in vector
products are the same thing.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,800
And now we want to
use our right hand

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,259
rule to get the direction
of the angular momentum.

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,170
So we curl our fingers.

33
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,420
And notice in this
case, it's pointing

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,150
into the plane of the figure.

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,620
And so the direction of the
angular momentum about s

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,170
is given into the plane of
the figure in our light board.

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,479
Now, we'll learn how to
calculate this cross product

38
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,470
in detail.

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,810
But suppose we have
our vectors which

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,300
are in a slightly
different arrangement

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,400
as seen in this figure here.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,570
Well, what we see is with the
vector p and the vector rs,

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,180
we still use our right
hand rule to calculate

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,978
the direction of Ls.

45
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:12,860
Notice, whenever you have
a vector cross product,

46
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,150
that the vector Ls is
perpendicular to both

47
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,840
the vectors rs and is
perpendicular to the vector p.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,150
And you can see in
both of these examples

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,420
that the angular momentum is
perpendicular to the plane

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,826
formed by the vectors rs and p.
