1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,039
We've now described what we call
the average velocity for a time

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,190
interval between when the
runner started at time t

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,790
to a later time
at t plus delta t.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,760
And we described
that as the component

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,410
of the displacement vector
divided by the time interval

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,540
times a unit vector, i hat.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,640
Now what we'd like to ask
is a separate question.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,370
So our question
now is, what do we

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:39,210
mean by the velocity at
some specific time, T1?

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,560
Now in order to understand
that, let's just

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,270
make a plot of the
position function.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,140
So remember we called the
component of the position

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,570
function x of t.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,660
So we're going to plot the
component of the position

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,920
function with respect to time.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,410
Now let's just say
that the runner started

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,050
at the origin of time equal 0.

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,560
So I can make some type of
arbitrary plot of that position

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,410
function.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,260
And let's indicate in
particular, the time T1.

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,690
So what this
represents is x of T1.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,450
And so first I'd like to
consider the interval T1

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,080
and T1 plus some
later time, delta T.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,670
So let's make this
T1 plus delta t.

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,220
This is the time
delta t and up here

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,170
we have our position
function at T1 plus delta T.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,090
Then for this time interval,
the average velocity,

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,690
so for this particular
time interval,

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,500
the average represents
delta x over delta t.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,100
So it's just rise over run.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,380
It's just the slope
of this straight line.

32
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,970
So for this particular
interval, the average

33
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:16,090
is the slope of the line
shown here on the figure.

34
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,350
Now this is just
an average velocity

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,320
and now what we would
like to do is shrink down

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,470
our interval delta T. So now
let's make another case where

37
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,840
we shrink delta t and
let's again calculate

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,990
the average velocity.

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,050
So for instance, suppose
we have a smaller delta t

40
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,520
and we draw that line.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Then our average velocity
represents that slope.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,840
And again, we keep
on taking a limit.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,420
So now we have another slope so
we have one slope, two slopes,

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,430
and now we shrink
again to a new delta t

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,760
and you can see that
the slope is changing.

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,690
And if we consider
the limit as delta t

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,210
goes to 0 of this
sequence of slopes,

48
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,640
then what are we getting,
you can see graphically,

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,190
that eventually we will
get to a line which

50
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:37,480
is the slope of the
tangent line at time T1.

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,200
And so in this
particular case, what

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,560
we mean by the instantaneous
velocity, v at time T1,

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,620
is the limit as delta
x goes to 0 i hat here

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,340
where we're taking,
this is the limit,

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,750
delta t goes to 0 x at
T1 plus delta t minus x1

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,480
of t divided by delta t and the
whole thing is a vector, i hat.

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,510
So what a limit is, is
a sequence of numbers.

58
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,660
So we take a fixed delta
t, we calculate the slope.

59
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,930
We take a smaller delta
t, calculate the slope.

60
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,250
And each time we do that,
the slopes represent

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,520
a sequence of numbers and
the limit of that sequence

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,120
you can see graphically,
is the slope

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,850
of the tangent line at time t 1.

64
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:44,300
And so what we say is, v of T1
is the instantaneous velocity

65
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,140
at time t equals t1.

66
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,650
And that's how we describe
instantaneous velocity

67
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,590
at some specific time.

68
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,460
If we were now being a
little bit more general,

69
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,180
we could just say
that v at any time t

70
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,630
is the limit delta
t goes to 0 delta

71
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,460
x over delta t ball
direction i hat,

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,210
and the only thing here is
we're no longer considering

73
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,730
T1 but an arbitrary time t.

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,460
This quantity, the limit, is
awkward to write every time.

75
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,680
It has a name.

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
And that's precisely what
we call the derivative

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,780
of the position function.

78
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,250
So our instantaneous velocity
is the time derivative

79
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,330
of the position function
at any instant in time.
