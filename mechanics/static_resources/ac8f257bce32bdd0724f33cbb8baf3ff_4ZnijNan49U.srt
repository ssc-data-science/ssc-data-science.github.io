1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,530
So we analyzed our
one-dimensional collision

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,670
where we had an object 1 moving
with some initial velocity,

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,740
object 2 also moving with
some initial velocity.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,570
And after the collision,
we just arbitrarily

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,840
said object 1 is moving
this way and object 2

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,250
was moving that way.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,620
And we called that
our i hat direction.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,280
In this collision,
we assume that it

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,460
was a frictionless surface.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,080
And there were no
external forces.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,730
So momentum is constant.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,100
Now what about energy?

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,310
Well, we know that if there
is no external forces, then

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,790
in principle there could
be no external work.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,300
However, during the
collision, we've

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,640
established different
types of collisions.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,980
We said elastic
collision is when

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,670
we are assuming that the kinetic
energy of the system-- that's

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:10,360
K system final minus
K system initial--

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,620
is 0, the statement that the
kinetic energy is constant.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:22,560
We have an inelastic
collision in which

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,460
delta K system has decreased.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,896
And that can come from some
deformation of the objects

24
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:29,770
during the collision.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,660
Heat is generated.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,560
Some sound, some
other source of energy

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,170
in which energy is
always constant,

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,170
but the kinetic energy of
the system could diminish.

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,289
And we also talked about
a super elastic collision.

30
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,080
And in this type of
collision, the kinetic energy

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,390
of the system has increased.

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,720
Now that's a little bit
tricky in terms of what

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
we're calling our system.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,280
But imagine that when
these two objects collided,

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,250
there was some type of
chemicals on it that exploded.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,380
And so that was
some chemical energy

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,710
that was converted into
extra kinetic energy.

38
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,360
So in order to make a
model of our problem,

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,780
we have to beforehand make some
assumptions about the nature

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,020
of the collision.

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,960
Now for our
particular collision,

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,540
let's assume that the
collision is elastic.

43
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,630
So we have two
conservation principles.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,780
We have that the kinetic energy
of the system is constant.

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,700
And we've already said
that because there's

46
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,270
no external forces, the momentum
of the system is constant.

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,650
So now we can write down our
kinetic energy condition.

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,462
We have m1 V1-- now here, this
can be a little bit tricky

49
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,420
how we're going to write
this, because remember

50
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,220
kinetic energy is
a magnitude squared

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:00,360
plus 1/2 m2 V2 initial squared
equals 1/2 m1 V1 final squared

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,040
plus 1/2 m2 V2 final squared.

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,810
Now because a
component, although it

54
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,900
can be positive or
negative, in one dimension,

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,170
if you square the component,
you get the magnitude.

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,300
So I can also write
this equation--

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,390
and I'm going to divide
through by the halves,

58
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,750
cancel all those-- as 1x initial
squared equal to the magnitude

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:36,400
squared plus m2 V2x
initial squared equals M1

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:45,235
V1x final squared plus
1/2 m2 V2x final squared.

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,500
And we've already
canceled all the halves,

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,230
so we have no half there.

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,210
Now given this equation--
we'll call this equation

64
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,780
1-- we can also had
our momentum equation,

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,640
which I'm going to
write down as 2, m1 Vx

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:25,790
initial plus m2 V2x initial
equals m1 V1x final plus m2 V2x

67
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,460
final, reminding
us of our condition

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,350
of the constancy of momentum.

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,570
So now, if you look at this,
if we're given the masses, all

70
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,880
the mi's and we're also
given the initial state

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,950
of the system, V2x
initial, then we

72
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,940
have two equations
and two unknowns.

73
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:57,740
And we can solve algebraically
for V1x final and V2x final.

74
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,320
And by determining the
signs of these components,

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,850
we can figure out the actual
final state of the system.

76
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,070
So this is going to end up
involving a quadratic equation.

77
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,760
And what we'd like to do now
is show an alternative way

78
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,800
that gives us another kind of
conservation, another principle

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,410
to analyze these one
dimensional collisions.

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,160
So we'll begin that.
