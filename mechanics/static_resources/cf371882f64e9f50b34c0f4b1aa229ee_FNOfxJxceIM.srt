1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,560
Let's look at a
typical application

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,570
of Newton's second law
for a system of objects.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,000
So what I want to consider is
a system of pulleys and masses.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,670
So I'll have a fixed
surface here, a ceiling.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,770
And from the ceiling,
we'll hang a pulley, which

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,970
I'm going to call pulley
A. And this pulley will

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,350
have a rope attached to
it, wrapped around it.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,090
And here we have object 1.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,220
And the rope goes
around the pulley.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,880
And now it's going to go
around another pulley B

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,550
and fixed to the ceiling.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,880
So that's fixed.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,200
And hanging from pulley
B is another mass 2.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,060
And our goal in applying
Newton's second law

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,180
is to find the accelerations
of objects 1 and 2.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,390
Now, how do we approach this?

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,260
Well, the first
thing we have to do

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,000
is decide if we're going to
apply Newton's second law, what

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,490
is the system that
we'll apply it to?

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,090
And there's many different
ways to choose a system.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,240
When we look at
this problem, we'll

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,850
have several different systems.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,710
So let's consider the ones
that we're going to look at.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,360
And the first one
is very simple.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
It will be block 1.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,440
And the second system
that we look at,

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,470
we'll call that AB is pulley A.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,860
Now that brings us to
an interesting question

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,810
about pulley B and block 2,
because we could separately

30
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,210
look at pulley B, and we could
separately consider block 2,

31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,979
or we consider them together.

32
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:52,840
And I want to first
consider separately pulley B

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,680
and block 2.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Now in some ways when you're
looking at a compound system,

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,600
and it has four
objects, it makes sense

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,720
to apply Newton's second law
to each object separately.

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,538
But we'll pay careful
attention to the fact

38
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,760
that object 2 is
connected to pulley B.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,030
And eventually,
we'll see that we

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,560
can combine these two things.

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,390
So the next step is
once we have identified

42
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,430
our object is to draw a free
body force diagrams for each

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,530
of the objects.

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,760
So in order to do that,
let's start with object 1.

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,620
And we want to consider
the forces on object 1.

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,710
Now that brings us
to our first issue

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,490
about what types of assumptions
we're making in our system.

48
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,380
For instance, we
have a rope that's

49
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,730
wrapped around this pulley.

50
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,610
And we have two pulleys that
in principle could be rotating.

51
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,920
But what we'd like to do to
simplify our analysis-- so

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,070
let's keep track of
some assumptions here.

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:01,615
Our first assumption will be
that the mass, MP, of pulley A

54
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,740
and the mass of pulley B
are approximately zero.

55
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,300
Now the reason for
that is that we're not

56
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,750
going to consider
any of the fact

57
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,410
that these objects have to be
put into rotational motion.

58
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,270
Later on in the course, we'll
see that this will give us

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,150
a more complicated analysis.

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,420
We're also going to assume
that our rope is not slipping.

61
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,650
So the rope is actually is
just slipping on the pulleys.

62
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,050
So what that means is
it's just the rope is

63
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,320
sliding as the objects move.

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,910
Now again, what this
is going to imply

65
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,430
is that the tension in
the rope-- this rope

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,329
is also slipping.

67
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,000
And the rope is
massless as well.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,380
It's very light rope.

69
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,970
And all of these
assumptions we've

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,140
seen when we analyze
ropes tell us

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,850
that the tension T is
uniform in the rope.

72
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,000
So that's our first assumption.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
And we need to think
about this before we even

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,490
begin to think about the
forces on the object.

75
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,480
And now we can draw our forces.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,690
What do we have?

77
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,370
We have the gravitational
force on object 1.

78
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,519
And now we can identify the
tension pulling in the string,

79
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,579
pulling object 1 up.

80
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,430
Now for every time we
introduce a free body diagram,

81
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,040
recall that we
have to choose what

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,550
we mean by positive directions.

83
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,800
And in this case, I'm going to
pick a unit vector down, j hat

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,310
1 down.

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,612
So that's my positive
direction for force.

86
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:40,180
Now before I write down
all of Newton's laws,

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,540
I'll just write down our
various force diagrams.

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,300
So for pulley A,
I have two strings

89
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,370
that are pulling it downwards.

90
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,380
So I have tension and tension.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,110
And this string, I'm
going to call that T2,

92
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,140
is holding that pulley up.

93
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,160
So we have the force diagram.

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,420
Now I could write
MAG, but we've assumed

95
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,920
that the pulley is massless.

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,250
And again, I'll
call j hat A down.

97
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,480
For object 2, let's
do pulley B first.

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,596
Now what are the
forces on pulley B?

99
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:29,980
I have strings on both sides,
T. Pulley B is massless,

100
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,916
so I'm not putting
gravitational force.

101
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:39,100
And this string is pulling
B downwards, so that's T3.

102
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,110
And again, we'll write
j hat B downwards.

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,180
And finally, I have block 2.

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,850
So I'll draw that over here.

105
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,230
I'll write block 2.

106
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,170
In fact, let's say
a little space here.

107
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,750
We'll have j hat B downwards.

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,430
Now block 2, what
do we have there?

109
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,770
We have the string
pulling up block 2,

110
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,760
which we've identified as T3.

111
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,670
And we have the gravitational
force on block 2

112
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,450
downward, M2 g.

113
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,220
And there we have j had 2.

114
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,400
So I've now drawn the free body
diagram of the various objects.

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,460
And that enables me to
apply Newton's second law

116
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,410
for each of these objects.

117
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,520
So let's begin.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
We'll start with object 1.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,920
We have-- remember in all
cases, we're going to apply F

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
equals m a.

121
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,860
So for object 1, we have
m1g positive downward minus

122
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,140
T is equal to m1 a1.

123
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,110
And that's our F
equals m a on object 1.

124
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,330
So sometimes we'll
distinguish that the

125
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,140
forces we're getting from
our free body diagram.

126
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,080
And A is a mathematical
description of the motion.

127
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:09,740
For block 2, we have m2g
minus T3 is equal to m2 a2.

128
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:18,590
And now for pulley A, we
have 2T pointing downwards

129
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,770
minus T2 going upwards.

130
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,350
And because pulley
A is massless,

131
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,670
this is zero even
though pulley A may

132
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,880
be-- it's actually fixed too.

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,310
So it's not even accelerating.

134
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,930
And what we see here
is this equation--

135
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,510
I'm going to quickly
note that it tells us

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:47,270
that the string holding pulley
2 up, T2, is equal to 2T.

137
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,890
So we can think of if,
we want to know what

138
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,330
T2 is, we need to calculate T.

139
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,495
And finally we have B. And
what is the forces on B?

140
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:03,150
We have T3 minus 2T.

141
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,260
And again pulley B is 0.

142
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,400
And so we see that
T3 is equal to 2T.

143
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,880
Now if you think about what
I said before about combining

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,610
systems, if we combine
pulley B in block 2,

145
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,420
visually what we're doing
is we're just adding these

146
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,640
to free body diagram together.

147
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,400
When we have a
system B and block 2.

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Let's call this j hat downwards.

149
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,570
And when we add these free
body diagram together,

150
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,940
you see that the T3 is now
internal force to the system.

151
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,080
It cancels in pair by
Newton's second law.

152
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,760
And all we have is the
two strings going up,

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,740
so we have T and T. And we
have the gravitational force

154
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,180
downward.

155
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,950
And separately, when we
saw that T3 equals 2T

156
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:10,420
and we apply it there, then
if we consider a system B2,

157
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,680
and look at our free body
diagram, we have m2g minus 2T--

158
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,330
and notice we have the same
result their 2T equals m2 a2.

159
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,820
So in principle now-- and
I'll outline our equations.

160
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,080
We have equation 1.

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,030
We have equation 2.

162
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,410
And in these two equations,
we have three unknowns, T, A1,

163
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,314
and A2, but only two equations.

164
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,730
And so you might
think, what about

165
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,300
this missing third
equation here?

166
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,260
However, in this equation,
we have a fourth unknown, T3.

167
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,760
And this equation is just
relating to T and T3.

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,800
So in principle, we
would have four unknowns

169
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,980
and three equations.

170
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,540
Or if we restrict our attention
to these two equations,

171
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,080
we have three unknowns
and two equations.

172
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,040
Are unknowns T, A1 and A2.

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,910
These are our unknowns.

174
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,030
And now our next step
is to try to figure out

175
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,800
what is the missing
condition that's relating

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,600
the sum of these unknowns.

177
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,730
And that will be a
constraint condition

178
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,090
that we'll analyze next.
