1
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,680
I would now like to calculate
the moment of inertia

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,050
for a very thin disk.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,950
So we have a thin disk.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,920
And the radius of
that disk is r.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,270
And it has a mass m.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,450
And I would like to calculate
the moment of inertia

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,830
for this disk.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,960
Now, let's just
remind what point

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,380
we're calculating it about,
about the center of mass.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,720
So our definition
of moment of inertia

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,057
was take a small element,
mass element to the disk.

12
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,390
In fact, we're going to see
it doesn't have to be small.

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,390
Take a mass element to
the disk that's useful,

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,900
and multiply it by the
perpendicular distance squared

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,240
from the point we're
calculating it.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,940
So the way I'll do it
is I will choose a ring.

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,860
I'm gonna choose a
ring of radius r.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,180
And now I'll make the
ring a certain thickness.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,830
And this thickness is dr.

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,930
Now, in this
calculation, we're going

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,100
to take a limit as
dr goes to zero.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,400
So even though the ring
has some finite thickness,

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,650
its radius-- we'll
eventually treat

24
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,560
treated as all of
the mass element

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,700
a distance r from the center.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,170
So r will be our
integration variable.

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,460
And that will be equal to
rcm, what we're calling

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,430
rcm in the abstract result.

29
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,140
Now, the dm is the tricky part.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,720
So what is the mass that's
contained in this area disk

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,300
of radius r and thickness dr?

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,080
Well, one way to think
about that is it's-- here we

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,380
didn't say this, but our
disk is going to be uniform.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,860
And so we can describe
the mass per unit area

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,920
as the total mass divided by
the area of the whole disk.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,000
And then we can say that
the mass in that ring

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,890
is equal to sigma
mass per area times

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:20,470
the area of the outer ring minus
the area of the inner ring.

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,980
Now, when we expand this
out, dm, m over pi r squared,

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,890
we get pi r squared plus
2rdr plus dr quantity

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,280
squared minus pi r squared.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,440
And you can see
those terms cancel.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,300
And so what I get is
m times pi r squared.

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,860
And in here I have
2 pi r dr. Now,

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,760
this is only order
dr, plus a second term

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,300
that goes like pi dr squared.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,310
And so, when I take this
limit as dr goes to 0,

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,760
this term is much, much
smaller than that term.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,770
And so I can say my mass
element is m pi r squared times

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,740
2 pi r dr.

51
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,730
Now, let's think about this
term, why it makes sense.

52
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,329
When we're shrinking our
ring, so taking a limit as dr

53
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,100
goes to 0, and the ring just
becomes an extremely thin ring

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,610
at radius r, then this
piece is a circumference,

55
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,700
and this piece is
just the width.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,040
And so it's no surprise
that area is 2 pi r

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,670
times d pi r dr in the limit.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,990
And now that enables us to
write the moment of inertia

59
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,950
about the center of mass, icm.

60
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,301
Let's pull out these
constants, m pi r squared.

61
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,800
Now we're integrating
over the body.

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Let's hold off on the
limits for the moment,

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,370
and put our values for dm.

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:10,610
That's 2 pi r dr. And we
have our distance squared,

65
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,990
which was, again, the
radius of r squared.

66
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,160
And so the pis will cancel.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,840
I have 2m over r-squared times
the integral of r cubed dr.

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,420
Now, we're supposedly
integrating over the body,

69
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,030
but what does that body
integral actually mean?

70
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,820
Well, what we're doing is
we're taking a series of rings

71
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,890
and adding them up as
we go from the origin

72
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,620
out to the radius
of the whole disk.

73
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,380
So the limits of our body
integral with respect

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,860
to our integration variable,
we start with rings

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,230
that essentially have no width.

76
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,500
And we're integrating
these, we're adding up

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,050
the contribution of
every ring until we

78
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,330
get to rings of radius r.

79
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,080
And our integration
variable, r cubed, dr.

80
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,970
Now, this is an integral
that's easy to do.

81
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,930
That's r to the forth over
4 between 0 and r equals r.

82
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,020
And when we put that
in, the 2 cancels the 4.

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,600
And oh, the pi we lost.

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,900
So let's make sure
this pi should be in m.

85
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,410
So we have the 2 over the 4
is one half, and r squared.

86
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,080
And that is the moment
of inertia of it

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,620
does about an axis
passing through the center

88
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,970
perpendicular to the
plane of the disk.
