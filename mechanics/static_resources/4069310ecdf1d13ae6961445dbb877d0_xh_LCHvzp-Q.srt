1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,120
Let's now consider how
to find the velocity

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,930
of the center of mass of a wheel
that's rolling without slipping

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,790
down an inclined plane.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,130
So let's draw a picture.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,320
Here is the wheel that
starts at t equals 0.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,740
And this is an angle phi.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,480
And at some later time
t final, the wheel

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,110
has dropped a distance h
along the incline plane.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,590
And now let's figure
out what is the velocity

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,800
of the center of
mass of the wheel

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,540
when it gets to the bottom.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,740
And we're now going to
apply our energy arguments.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,180
Now the first thing we have to
realize is a very subtle point

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,630
here is that there
can be friction.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,870
And we saw that when a wheel
is rolling without slipping,

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,070
there can be static
friction at the contact

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,700
point between the
wheel and the ground.

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,520
There is a gravitational force.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,800
And a normal force.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Now static friction does no
work because the point is always

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,960
instantaneously at
rest and f dot ds is 0

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,900
because the object is at rest.

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,680
And so the ds is 0.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
So our static
friction does no work.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,289
And therefore, from
our energy principle

26
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:49,800
that the external work equals
E final minus E initial,

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:57,210
we have no external work and
so our energy is constant.

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,759
Now how do we
analyze our energy?

29
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,120
Well, I've set things up.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,370
So I'm going to choose my
potential energy to be 0

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,380
when it's at the bottom.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,350
And that our initial energy is
only equal to potential energy.

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,670
If the wheel has a mass m,
gravitational force down,

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,060
the potential energy
initially is mgh.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,160
The final energy is
only kinetic energy.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,310
The wheel is rolling
with omega final.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,670
Its center of mass is moving
with v center of mass final.

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,610
And we just saw that
the kinetic energy

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,530
has two contributions; the
translational kinetic energy,

40
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,320
1/2 m--

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,220
we'll just call
this final squared.

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,000
And we'll make that the
final just to make it easier.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,190
And it has the kinetic
energy of rotation.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,060
Now the rolling without
slipping condition

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,760
is that the translational
center of mass speed

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,250
is equal to the
radius of the wheel,

47
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,440
r, times the angular
speed, omega final.

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,320
So I can write E final
as 1/2 of m plus I

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:22,260
cm over r squared times the
final squared, where I'm just

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,690
replacing omega final
equals v final over r.

51
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,230
And therefore, that the kinetic
energy by the energy principle

52
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,900
tells us that E
initial equals E final.

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,110
So mgh equals 1/2
times m plus I cn

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,810
over r squared v final square.

55
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,500
So we can find that v final is
equal to the square root of 2

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,510
mgh divided by m
plus 1/2 cm r square.

57
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,840
And that is the final
speed of the center

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,110
of mass translational's
velocity of the wheel

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,280
as it dropped a height h.
