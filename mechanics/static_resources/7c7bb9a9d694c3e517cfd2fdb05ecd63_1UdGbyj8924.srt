1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,760
When solving physics problems,
we have fundamental principles.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,030
For instance, we have
Newton's second law.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,070
And we also have an
energy principle,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,090
work non-conservative equals
the change in kinetic energy

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,460
plus the change in
potential energy.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,440
And many times
students are challenged

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,170
by-- do I use this law?

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,420
Do I use that law?

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,220
Why do I use one or the other?

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,710
Do I use both at the same time?

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,930
Can I get the same
answers, et cetera.

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,280
Now I want to illustrate a
particular category of problems

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,650
where we have some type
of circular motion,

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,830
and why we need to use
both of these laws.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,250
So let's consider, let's go
back to our dome example at MIT.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,090
And let's say we have an
object that's on the dome.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,610
And now let's write out a free
body diagram for this object.

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,420
So we have our
gravitational force.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,520
We have a normal force.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,390
And here, let's just assume
that our dome is frictionless,

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,510
for simplicity.

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:14,860
So what you see here is that
the object is displacing

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,310
in a direction-- now here if
I choose r hat and theta hat,

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,070
and if I choose a
coordinate system where

25
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,650
I take my positive
angle theta this way,

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,830
that the normal force and the
displacement are perpendicular.

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:41,860
Now what that means is that the
work done by the normal force,

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,380
F normal dot ds is 0,
because well, we're

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,670
calling F normal equal
to the normal force

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,430
and that the normal force is
perpendicular to displacement.

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,850
So what that means
is all information

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,980
about the normal force is
not included in the energy

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,730
principle.

34
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,000
In fact, the energy
principle is-- the work

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,690
that's done is just the
amount-- this is angle theta,

36
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,520
so this is angle theta--
so the actual work done

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,510
by the gravitational force g
is the component of g mg sine

38
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,520
theta times the displacement ds.

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,240
So the only work
that's appearing here,

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,530
and this is conservative.

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,010
And so when we
integrated this work

42
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,280
and got that the work done
by the gravitational force

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,780
is minus the change in potential
energy, that's showing up here.

44
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,530
So the part of the force that's
in the direction of the motion

45
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,280
is giving us the
energy condition.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,340
But we're losing all
information about the forces

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,210
in the radial direction.

48
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:18,160
So because also what we
need is Newton's second law

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,600
in the direction perpendicular
to the displacement.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Displacement is in the
theta hat direction,

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,290
so we need Newton's second
law in the radial direction.

52
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,300
And that we have r hat,
is we have a normal force

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,420
minus mg co-sine theta.

54
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,930
And the object is
undergoing circular motion,

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:51,760
so it's equal to minus
mv squared over R,

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,850
where R is the
radius of the dome.

57
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,329
This equation is
not at all included

58
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,829
in the energy condition.

59
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,330
You may say, well what about the
tangential Newton's second law,

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:15,910
which is mg sine theta equals
mR d squared theta dt squared.

61
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,390
But it's precisely
this equation that's

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:29,450
integrated with respect
to the displacement

63
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,534
and that gives us
our energy principle.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,250
So in summary, the
energy principle

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,650
is the integration of
Newton's second law

66
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,140
in the direction of motion.

67
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,610
And we're completely
missing the application

68
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,355
of Newton's second law in
the direction perpendicular

69
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,210
to the motion.

70
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,350
Energy does not
account for that.

71
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,010
And that's why we
needed separately

72
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,660
to apply both of the
principles of energy

73
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,960
and Newton's second law
in the radial direction

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,380
in order to figure out
how to solve this problem.

75
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,410
Now this idea is true in general
when you have circular motion,

76
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,870
you need the energy
equation, which

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,040
is the tangentially
integrated Newton's second

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,110
on the tangential direction.

79
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,060
And you need Newton's second law
in the direction perpendicular

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,892
to that circular motion.
