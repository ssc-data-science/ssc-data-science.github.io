00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,080
Today, we'd like to
discuss tension in a rope.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,850
Under what conditions
is the tension uniform?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,170
Recall that if we had a rope
and say we were pulling-- here's

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,170
our one end.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,570
We'll call that we're pulling
at this end with the force a.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,770
And we pull on this
end b with a force b.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,100
Then what we meant by tension
at any point in the rope

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,350
was that we took an
imaginary slice of the rope p

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,120
and we looked at the two sides.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,460
And here-- if we call this
the left side and this is

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,320
the right side-- then
on the left side,

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,970
we have that the
right side of the rope

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,190
is pulling the left side of
the rope by some force f.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,590
And this is the left side.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,000
And the right side is being
pulled by the left side.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,450
So that's the right side
being pulled by the left.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,990
And what we define the
tension at the point p

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,840
was to be the magnitude of
this action-reaction pair.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,100
And that's how we define tension
at a point inside a rope.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,680
Now we'd like to address the
question, under what conditions

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,830
can we say that the
tension is uniform?

22
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,250
Which means that at all points
p, the tension is the same.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,430
In order to analyze this, we'll
apply Newton's second law.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,640
So let's begin with the
same situation as before.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,690
Let's consider a rope where
we're pulling this side

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,880
with a force at the end.

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,755
By the way, we can call the
tension at that end T of a.

28
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:46,900
And on this side,
we can refer to this

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,900
as the tension on side b.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,870
Now suppose that our mass
of the rope is non-zero.

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,920
And we now want to apply
Newton's second law.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,450
But let's also
apply the condition

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,500
that the acceleration
of the rope is non-zero.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,889
So you're holding the
rope under some tension

35
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,700
by pulling both sides.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,720
But the rope is
not accelerating.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,600
And so what does that mean
when we apply Newton's

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,130
second law to the rope?

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,800
Well, let's just
arbitrarily call that

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,350
our positive direction.

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,370
We see by vector decomposition
that we have Tb minus Ta

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,210
equals mass of the rope.

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,180
But because the acceleration
of the rope is zero,

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,930
this side is zero.

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,820
And we can use
Newton's second law

46
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,910
to conclude that the
tension in the rope

47
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,180
is uniform when the rope
is not accelerating.

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,030
And this is what we'll
call our case one.

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,079
A zero tension in
the rope is uniform.

50
00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:01,080
Now let's suppose case
two, that a is not zero.

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,510
And so now we have the rope.

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,900
This is point b.

53
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,250
Here's point a.

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,213
We'll choose a
uniform direction a.

55
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:18,890
And now we can see
when we apply F equals

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,480
Ma, that Tb minus Ta
equals mass of the rope

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,710
times the acceleration
of the rope.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,960
So you're pulling such
that Tb is greater

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,160
than Ta by precisely
the quantity Mr times a.

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
So the tension at the
ends are not the same.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
And therefore, the tension
in the rope is not uniform.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Now there's a special case
here that we want to consider.

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,990
So even though a
is nonzero, let's

64
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,510
assume that the mass of
the rope is very small.

65
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,670
And this is often--
people call this

66
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,851
assume the rope is massless.

67
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,370
Well, that's a little strange.

68
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,870
We can say that the very,
very light string is often

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,590
the same type of modeling.

70
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,500
And under those circumstances
with that assumption,

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,990
you see that there is
no contribution here.

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,060
And with that assumption,
that the tension

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,829
is approximately uniform.

74
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,210
Ropes are not massless.

75
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,790
There's a small difference.

76
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,980
But under those circumstances
when we say a very light rope

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,680
that-- even if it is
accelerating-- implies

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,610
that T is uniform in the rope.

79
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,810
And we can say the rope
is under uniform tension.

80
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,790
And we will often
refer to this case

81
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,430
when we analyze
problems where we're

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,040
pulling objects, for instance,
in a typical pulley problem.
