1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,510
We now look at representing
vectors by their magnitude

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,102
and direction.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,050
In this example, we
have a force here.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,030
We can represent this force
by its magnitude, which

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,530
is the length of the vector,
and the angle from the x-axis

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,510
going towards the y-axis.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,490
We can also separately
represent the velocity

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,900
as a vector with its own
magnitude and direction.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,910
Notice that in this
example the velocity

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,809
is in a different
direction than the force.
