1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,510
When we analyze the
problem about putting

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,320
two blocks along a
frictionless surface

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,050
and pushing one and asking,
what is the maximum force such

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,290
that block 2 does not slip?

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,910
We have three different systems.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,700
And now I want to
focus a little bit

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,010
on what would happen if we
just naively chose our systems

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,230
as both blocks together.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,050
So let's try to look
at the types of issues

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,190
that come up when we do that.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,890
So once again, let's
draw free body diagrams.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,270
Now, we begin.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,290
We're pushing block
1 with a force.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,160
Gravitation is the sum
of these two forces,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,560
because our system here
is block 1 and block 2.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,620
What about normal forces?

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,580
Well, the ground is
acting on block 1.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,230
And now, here's the
significant thing.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,980
What about all of those
forces between blocks 1 and 2?

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:17,803
Well, the forces between blocks
1 and 2 are internal forces.

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,900
And we saw that they were
friction forces, f12 and f21.

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,200
This was the friction force
between the two blocks,

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,800
on block 2 due to 1 and the
friction force on block 1

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
due to 2.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,800
There were normal forces
between these two blocks,

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,235
but these are interaction pairs.

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,930
And the sum of them are 0.

28
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,210
And so we see that all internal
forces form Newton's third law

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,450
interaction pairs and the
vector sum of them are 0.

30
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,260
And that's why I don't
need those internal forces

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,990
on my free body diagram.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,840
If I were to draw them, I
would have different arrows.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,210
For instance, I would
have that arrow f21

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,920
and I would have the arrow f12.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,570
And you can see that
the sum of those cancel.

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:28,680
I would have the arrow n21 and
I would have the arrow n12.

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,500
Arrows in opposite directions.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,360
The interaction pairs
sum to 0, because they

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,530
are internal forces.

40
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,340
And again, this enables
us now to just draw

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,390
f equals m1 plus m2 times the
acceleration of the system.

42
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,310
And so we have our i hat
and our j hat directions.

43
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,352
Let's pick i hat and j hat.

44
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:03,180
And now, we didn't include
the kinetic friction force

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,550
of the ground in that system.

46
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,980
So let's make sure
that that's there.

47
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,330
And what we have is
f minus f kinetic

48
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,565
equals m1 plus m2 times a.

49
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,940
And in the vertical
direction, we

50
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:25,200
have n ground 1 minus
m1 plus m2 g equals 0.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,870
That gave us our
same result before.

52
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,650
Notice that f equals
fk plus m1 plus m2 g.

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:47,690
We know this is mu km1 plus
m2 g plus m1 plus m2 g a.

54
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,490
So we have the
acceleration of the system

55
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:03,890
depends on the force, mu k
m1 plus m2g divided by m1 m2.

56
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,300
But notice because
our static friction

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,480
is an internal force
in this system,

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,030
it never shows up in
Newton's second law,

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,790
so we were never able
to apply the condition

60
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,790
that f static max
was mu static n,

61
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,310
what we call the normal
force between the blocks.

62
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,900
And so we were unable to figure
out what is the maximum force.

63
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,690
All we can say is if I push
f, that's the acceleration.

64
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,020
But I cannot determine what
maximum force will cause block

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,570
2 to slip with
respect to block 1.

66
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,100
So when you pick your
system like this,

67
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,730
it's very quick to calculate a.

68
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,990
No problem about that.

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,930
But I am not able to
answer any questions that

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,760
require some type of information
about the internal forces.

71
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,160
So the art to choosing
systems and free body diagrams

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,980
is to think about the types
of questions you're asking.

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,120
If you have a question
that involves something

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,950
about a maximum condition
on static friction,

75
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,160
then you want to make sure
that static friction is

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,270
an external force
to your system.

77
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,800
If it's an internal
force, like in this case,

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,065
you will not be able to
apply that condition.
