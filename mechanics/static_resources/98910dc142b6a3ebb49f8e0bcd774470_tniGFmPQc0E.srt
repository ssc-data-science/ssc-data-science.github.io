1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,540
Let's examine again
an object that's

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,610
undergoing circular motion.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,160
And we'll choose our polar
coordinates r hat, theta hat.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,710
We'll make it
cylindrical with a k hat.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,920
Now that we've completed
our kinematic description

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,430
of the motion, now let's see
how we apply Newton's second law

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,430
to circular motion.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,320
Well, when we write
Newton's second law as F

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,680
equals ma, that-- remember,
we can divide these two sides.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,490
This side, the how, is
a geometric description

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,770
of the motion.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,420
And this side is
the why, and this

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,580
is the dynamics of the motion.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,630
And the dynamics come from
analyzing the forces that

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,780
are acting on this object.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,050
So when we're applying
this mathematically

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,720
to circular motion, F equals
ma-- this is a vector equation.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,260
And so what we need to do is
think about each component

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,370
separately.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,820
Sometimes I can just
distinguish the components

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,710
that I'm talking
about over here.

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,440
And so we have that the radial
component of the forces--

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,420
and that comes from an
analysis of the dynamics,

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,750
the physics of the problem--
and this side is mass times

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,150
the radial component of
the acceleration, ar.

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,320
Now these are very
different things.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,490
And it's by the
second law that we're

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,500
equating in quantity
these two components.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,039
Now if we wrote that equation--
this side out in a little bit

30
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,270
more detail-- we'll
save ourselves

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,430
a little space when we handle
the tangential direction--

32
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,539
the forces come from analysis
of free body force diagrams.

33
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:59,430
And over here, we know the
acceleration is always inward.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,060
And I'll choose to write
this as r omega squared.

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,250
And so this will be
our starting point

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,140
for analyzing the radial
motion for an object that's

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,870
undergoing circular motion.

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,430
Now remember, there could
be a tangential motion, too.

39
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,610
And in the tangential
direction, the tangential forces

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,790
are equal to ma tangential.

41
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,960
And as we saw, this is
again the second law,

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,720
equating two different things.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,520
We have that we can write
the tangential force as r

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,170
d squared theta dt squared.

45
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,300
And sometimes we've been
writing that as r alpha z.

46
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,620
But this equation
here is what we're

47
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,320
going to apply for
the tangential forces.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,680
If the tangential forces
are 0, then there's

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,220
no angular-- there's no
tangential acceleration.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,570
We know that for
circular motion,

51
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,360
the radial force
can never be zero,

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,160
because this term
is always non-zero

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,410
and points radially inward.

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,730
And now we'll look at
a variety of examples

55
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,580
applying Newton's second
law to circular motion.
