1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,770
We would now like to look at
two-dimensional collisions.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,310
And what we'd like to look at
is in the laboratory frame--

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,710
so I'll call that the lab
frame-- in which we have

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,370
a target particle, which
I'm going to call 2,

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,710
and an incoming particle
1, which is coming in

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,800
with some initial velocity.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,960
After the collision,
let's imagine

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,700
that the target
particle is going out

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,980
at a certain direction.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,570
So we'll call that 2.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,450
And the target particle
has a velocity v2 final.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,530
And the initial particle that's
going in this direction-- we'll

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,730
call that 1.

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,390
And that is it's
outcoming velocity.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,930
Now in this collision, we
want to ask ourselves first,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,420
what quantities are
constants of the motion.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, let's assume
no external forces,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,890
therefore momentum is constant.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,750
And we can write our
momentum equation

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:10,480
as m1 v1 initial equals m1
v1 final plus m2 v2 final.

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,700
Now recall that
momentum is a vector.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:20,230
And so what we have here
are two-- the unknowns here

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,840
are our two outcoming vectors,
v1 final and v2 final.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,380
And a vector in two
dimensions has two quantities.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,770
We can discuss-- we can
write that as components.

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,289
Or we can write it in terms
of magnitudes and directions.

27
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:40,360
Now experimentally, we often
will measure the directions

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,280
of the outcoming
particles, which

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,970
I will now indicate by theta
2 final and theta 1 final.

30
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,789
And so, when we write our
two momentum equations,

31
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,190
we can either write
it as components,

32
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,660
or we can write it in terms
of magnitudes and directions

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,740
and do vector decomposition.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,430
Now because we measure
the outcoming directions,

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,260
we're going to choose to do
magnitudes and directions.

36
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,090
So let's indicate
a little notation.

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,800
We'll say that the magnitude
of v1 initial is v1 i.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,550
And the magnitude of
v2 final is v2 final.

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,380
And the magnitude of
v1 final is v1 final.

40
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,690
And so now, when we look at
our two momentum conditions,

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,940
we can-- we now also
have to introduce

42
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,530
unit vectors for directions.

43
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,990
So let's call i hat that way
and j hat in this direction.

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,570
And in our i hat
direction, we have

45
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,070
only the incoming momentum.

46
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,470
And we can write that
as m1 v1 initial.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,430
It's positive because we've
chosen the forward direction

48
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,360
as our i hat direction.

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,950
Now in terms of the outgoing
momentum in the i hat

50
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,890
direction, we have to
do vector decomposition

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,150
of both of these vectors.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,800
And they both have
positive components.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,690
So we have m1 v1 final-- that's
the magnitude-- cosine theta

54
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,030
1 final plus-- positive
sign, because they're

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,010
both in the positive
direction-- v2 final magnitude

56
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,870
times-- we need that little-- m2
v2 final cosine theta 2 final.

57
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,760
And that is our i hat direction.

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,920
Now the j hat
direction-- remember,

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,340
we have to be careful, because
we're taking positive j hat up.

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,420
So our particle 2 has a positive
component in the j direction.

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,700
And our particle 1 has
a negative component

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,020
in the j direction.

63
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,329
The incoming momentum-- there's
no momentum in the j direction.

64
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,970
So we have a 0.

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,000
And that's equal to
positive m2 v2 final.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,462
And that's a sine theta 2 final.

67
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:00,170
Now, here's where you
have to be careful,

68
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,350
because this one is negative.

69
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,080
Component is in the
negative j hat direction.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,710
And we have m1 v1 final
sine theta 1 final.

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,040
And these two represent
our momentum equations.

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,110
Now we also have to think--
let's think about energy.

73
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,420
Again, we have to know
something about this collision.

74
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,320
And our assumption will be
that this particular collision

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,730
is elastic.

76
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,770
And that means the
initial kinetic energy

77
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,480
is equal to the
final kinetic energy.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,909
Energy is a scalar.

79
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,090
We've been describing our
incoming velocity vectors

80
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,780
in terms of magnitudes.

81
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,620
So we can write our
elastic energy condition

82
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,000
as the incoming kinetic
energy squared--

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,250
that's the kinetic
energy incoming--

84
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:55,470
is equal to 1/2 m1 v1
final squared plus 1/2

85
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,570
m2 v2 final squared.

86
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,010
And that is our kinetic
energy condition.

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,100
Let's label this equation
1 and equation 2.

88
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,350
Now, it's very
important to realize

89
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,370
which quantities are given and
which we need to solve for.

90
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,640
So in this problem, because
the two outcoming velocities--

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,560
unknowns-- we have
four unknowns.

92
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,790
Those unknowns can be written
in terms of the two velocity

93
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,450
final and the other
one, v2 final.

94
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,909
Those are our vector quantities.

95
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,200
But recall, in terms of
the scalar magnitudes,

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,820
we have that v1 final.

97
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,940
And I'll just write the
other ones down-- v2 final,

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,810
and the two outgoing
directions-- theta 1 final

99
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,240
and theta 2 final.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,110
So these are our four
unknown quantities.

101
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,230
But you can see we only
have three equations.

102
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,190
And therefore, if we want
to determine the outcomes,

103
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:10,280
we need to measure one
additional quantity.

104
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Now that's very useful
when doing problem solving,

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,290
because when you start
to read a problem,

106
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,330
and you look at
what's being measured,

107
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,200
you can right away determine
which of the four quantities

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,890
has been given.

109
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,330
You may be given an outgoing
magnitude of the velocity,

110
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,480
or you may be given one of
these scattering angles.

111
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,420
And so that's how we approach
two-dimensional elastic

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,440
collision.

113
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,587
Of course there's
algebra now to solve

114
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,670
for any particular quantity
that you're interested

115
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,280
in, provided you have this
extra additional information.
