1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,380
We've already talked
about kinetic energy

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,780
for an object that's
rotating and translating.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,300
Let's take, again, a
simple object like a wheel.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,580
Center of mass is
moving, and we want

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,280
to consider this is a bunch
of point-like particles,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,510
th Jth particle with mass MJ,
and a position vector RCMJ.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,740
And now what we'd like to do
is, what is the angular momentum

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,950
of this about some point P?

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,290
And we're going to do the
same type of decomposition

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,190
that we've been
doing right along.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,640
Let's draw the vector RJ.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,900
This is the vector from
the point P to the object.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,490
Here's the vector capital R,
and there's the vector RCMJ.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,720
And our same vector
addition, R plus RCMJ.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,510
j Now let's calculate
the angular momentum

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,150
about the point
P. Now just let's

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,390
recall two facts about the
center of mass reference frame

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,440
that we've already used.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,830
The first is that the sum of
the velocities, the momentum

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,380
in the center of mass
reference frame is zero,

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,470
and if you integrate this
equation in just exactly

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,600
the same way, if you added
up the mass times each

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,900
of the position
vectors, that's MJ,

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,630
MJ, in the center of mass
frame, that's also zero.

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,800
So we've used this when we
talked about kinetic energy.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,860
Now we're going to consider
both of these results.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,729
So recall that angular
momentum about a point

28
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:54,710
is the sum of the vector from
the point, cross-product MJ,

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,920
times the velocity BJ.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,790
Now we can also use our
law of addition velocities,

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,910
VJ is V plus the
VCMJ, and so now

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,060
we're going to have to
do both substitutions.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,270
That's why this calculation is
a little bit more complicated.

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:25,390
We have R plus RCMJ,
cross MJ times capital

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,070
D. That is the velocity
of the center of mass

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,829
with respect to the
ground frame plus VCMJ.

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,100
Now we have four terms
in the cross-product,

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,440
and this time we'll
write them all out.

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:51,540
So the first term is the sum
over J of R cross MJ capital D.

40
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,200
The second term is,
we'll take this one,

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,490
and we'll cross with that one.

42
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,990
But because MJ is just a scalar,
I'm going to pull it in front.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:08,190
So that's MJ, RCMJ, and V is the
same for every single particle

44
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,390
in the object.

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,780
Remember, V is just the
velocity of one reference frame

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,100
with respect to the other.

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,380
So I can pull that out, cross
V. And you're already noticing

48
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,640
that this term will be zero.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,170
The next term is
when I take R cross

50
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,260
MJVJ, V center of
mass, J, summed over J,

51
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:38,620
that's JR cross MJ, VCMJ.

52
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,970
But again, remember that
R is the same vector.

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,400
It's just from P to
the center of mass,

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,430
so I didn't need to
put the sum here.

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,310
I can pull R out of the sum
and I have my sum like that.

56
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,740
And again, you're probably
noticing that this term is zero

57
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,350
and our final term is
RCMJ cross MJ VCMJ.

58
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,300
So our final term is sum
R, RCMJ cross MJ VCMJ.

59
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,899
Now from these two
conditions, one and two,

60
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,829
both of these two
terms are zero.

61
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,700
And that's the power of using
the center of mass reference

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,510
frame.

63
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,290
So LP, now let's look
at the first term.

64
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,060
Here, R is the same
for every particle,

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,000
V is the same for
every particle,

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,620
when we're summing
over the mass,

67
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,510
we're just getting
the total mass,

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,610
so the first piece
is R cross M total V.

69
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,380
And this last piece is precisely
the definition of the angular

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,600
momentum of the Jth particle
in the center of mass frame.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,490
So that's the sum
over J of LCMJ,

72
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,540
because RCM cross MVJ R
cross, say whatever speed this

73
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,330
is in the center of mass frame,
it could be that sum VCMJ.

74
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,070
BJ minus capital V.

75
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,010
This is exactly the
angular momentum

76
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,460
of that Jth mass in the
center of mass frame,

77
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,540
and when we total all of
this up, we have R cross

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,810
and total V plus LCM.

79
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,780
Now what this first term is,
if you treated the whole object

80
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,480
as a point mass, M total, moving
with V, and here's our point P

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,090
and there's R, this
is just what we

82
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,050
call the translational
angular momentum.

83
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,500
It's treating the whole
system as a point-like mass,

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,320
and just calculate
moving with speed V,

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,450
and that's just the
angular momentum.

86
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,290
We've called this V.

87
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:12,360
And this piece is the angular
momentum about center of mass.

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,480
So sometimes, we can think
of the angular momentum

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,010
as corresponding
to a translational,

90
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,610
it has to do with the
actual orbit of the object.

91
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,810
You could call this
orbital angular momentum.

92
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,050
And this is the fact that
the object is rotating.

93
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,010
You could think of this as
the spin angular momentum

94
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,750
about the center of mass.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,940
This is the same
type of decomposition

96
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,710
that we saw with kinetic energy.

97
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,590
There was a translational
component of kinetic energy

98
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,980
and a rotational component
of kinetic energy.

99
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,450
This is the analogous case for
angular momentum about a point

100
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,700
P.
