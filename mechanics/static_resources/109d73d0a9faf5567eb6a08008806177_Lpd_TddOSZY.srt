1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's look at these
two blocks here.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,470
Block 1 has a mass of 3m and
Block 2 has a mass of 1 m.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,870
And they're colliding
and sticking together.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,239
And then they're going
to move in this direction

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,230
and eventually, slide onto
this rough surface here.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,480
What we want to
figure out is, what

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,250
was that initial
velocity v0 with which

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,990
the two blocks collided?

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,450
So up to this part here--
before this x equals 0--

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,750
there's no external force
acting on the system.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,510
So conservation
of momentum holds,

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:47,260
which means that p
final equals p initial.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,240
So let's put this together.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,260
We're going to have 3m v0.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,530
That block goes in the
positive i hat direction.

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,550
Block 2 goes the opposite
way, so we have m v0.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,830
And then at the end, when
they're stuck together

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,280
before here, we have to
consider only this portion here

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,220
that pertains to a
frictionless surface.

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,690
We have 4m v final.

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,990
And so the m's fall out.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,230
This is 2.

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,630
This is 4.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,440
So we'll see that the
final velocity is v0 half.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,460
Now, in order to get
to this v0, we also

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,650
have to consider energy.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,009
And in particular, we have to
use the work energy principle

28
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,840
here, because this joint
block is going to slide

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,490
onto this rough surface here.

30
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,315
So we can make use of the
work energy principle,

31
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:54,100
as we know what the initial
conditions are at this point

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,900
here, using the
conservation of momentum

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,090
from here in the first place.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,100
So we want to use work equals
delta K, the work energy

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,150
principle.

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,090
Let's look at the work first.

37
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,150
Work is the integral
of F dot dS.

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,520
And we're dealing with a
one-dimensional problem

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,040
here, so we can
just write Fx dx.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,910
And we want to have
this run from 0 to d.

41
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,380
I should say here that
this block eventually

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,460
comes to rest at x equals d.

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,290
We're going to use
that in a second.

44
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,760
So let's look at what this F is.

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,850
That's the frictional
force here at work.

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,870
And actually, which
direction does it go?

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,840
It opposes the motion fk.

48
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:04,630
So we're going to get a minus
sign here, integral fk dx,

49
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,600
again going from x prime
equals 0 to x prime equals d.

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:20,090
Now what is this fk ?We
know that fk equals mu k N.

51
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,230
And from doing a quick
free body diagram,

52
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,280
we'll see that we
have 4mg going down,

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,670
and we have a normal
force going up.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,060
So we'll see that N equals 4mg,
which we can then plug in here.

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,980
And then that goes over there.

56
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,470
And the coefficient
of kinetic friction

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,680
is actually given to us.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,140
So that nicely works out.

59
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,560
So we're going to have minus
integral x prime 0, x prime

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:05,980
equals d, the coefficient first,
b x squared, and then N 4mg dx.

61
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,340
If we integrate that, we're
going to get minus 4bmg.

62
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:22,970
And we'll integrate this one,
so that's x cubed over 3.

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,860
And we're going to plug
in this value here,

64
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,370
so we're going to get a d, and
that second term goes away.

65
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,700
So we are left
with d cubed here.

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,430
So this is our work.

67
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,380
And now we need to look at
the change in kinetic energy

68
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,720
between here and there.

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,580
We already know that this
block is at rest at x equals d.

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,050
So if the velocity is 0, our
kinetic energy will be 0,

71
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,720
and so our K final
minus K initial

72
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,240
is going to be
just minus initial.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,240
And that's initial here,
which is the final situation

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,800
of our collision.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,170
So we're going to look
at the combined block.

76
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:14,450
So we'll have minus 1/2 and
we have 4mv final squared.

77
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,550
We determined here already
that the final velocity is

78
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:25,030
the initial 1/2, so have minus.

79
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,740
Here we're going to have 2m,
and now v0 squared over 4.

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:43,846
And that actually gives
us minus 1/2 m v0 squared.

81
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,610
OK, so now we can put
this all together.

82
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,810
We apply this work
energy principle.

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:02,080
So we're going to get
minus 4/3 bmg d cubed

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,860
equals minus 1/2 m v0 squared.

85
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,810
We'll see that this and
this and this and this goes.

86
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:23,230
And so we're going
to get v0 equals 8/3,

87
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:30,640
and then we have bgd cubed
and the square root of that.

88
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,600
So this is our initial velocity
with which the two blocks

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,110
collided initially,
then eventually went

90
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,750
onto this rough surface and
came to rest here at x equals d.
