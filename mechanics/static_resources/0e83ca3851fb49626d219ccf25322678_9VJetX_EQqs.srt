1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,350
We've seen the rocket
equation, and we've

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,870
studied the example when
there's no external forces.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,920
Now, let's consider an example
when the external force is not

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,150
0.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,310
Well, one of our
examples is just a rocket

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,380
taking off in a
gravitational field.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,560
And so when we want to focus
on the external forces,

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,970
let's draw our
rocket at time, t.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,689
And now, consider-- what are the
force diagrams on this rocket?

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,190
Well, we have a
gravitational force, mg.

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,860
So we're going to
choose j hat up.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,590
So now, what does our
rocket equation look like?

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,650
We wrote the exhaust
velocity as minus mu j hat.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,490
And so if we write this now as
a vector equation in the j hat

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,090
component, we get minus mg.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,240
We have the rate that the
rocket mass is changing,

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,740
and this is in our-- we
have this as-- remember,

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,200
dm dr/dt is going
to be negative.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,750
So there's a minus.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,080
And over here, we have another--
this is u because u is minus u.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,725
And finally, we have
m rocket dvr/dt.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,570
Now, once again, we're
going to try to integrate--

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,460
this is actually equal.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,830
And we're going to try to
integrate this equation

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,850
to find a solution for the
velocity as a function of time

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,340
when all the fuel is burned.

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,630
So what we do is we'll
multiply through by dt,

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,080
and we have minus dmr
times u equals mr dvr.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,630
And this is mass of the rocket.

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,080
And now, let's divide through
by mass of the rocket,

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:11,330
so we have minus g minus
dmr over mru equals dvr.

32
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,070
And once again, we can
integrate this equation

33
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,350
from some initial time
to some final time.

34
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,700
I'll just denote that by
i initial and i final,

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,560
and what we see here is we have
minus g times t final minus t

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,270
initial because
we're integrating

37
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,680
with respect to time.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,329
Here, we're integrating mass,
so that's minus mu natural log.

39
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:43,579
And I'm going to write this
as mr final over mr initial.

40
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,310
And over here, we have vr
final minus vr initial.

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,590
And let's just
remove that time, t.

42
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,190
And so now, here is
our rocket equation.

43
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,990
Now, what we notice
here is-- let's look

44
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,370
at some rocket taking off.

45
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,700
So suppose that, at
10 initial equals 0,

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,460
we have the special condition
that vr initial equals 0

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,650
and mr initial equals the
mass of the rocket-- dry mass.

48
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,970
That's all.

49
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,980
That's not counting the fuel.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,450
Plus the total mass of the fuel.

51
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,690
And the final-- at t final, when
the engine turns off-- we're

52
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,440
going to try to find
this velocity at t final.

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,960
And our condition
for the final mass

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,140
is all the fuel has been
burned, so this is just

55
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,750
the dry mass of the rocket.

56
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,510
And so what we get is
we get minus g t final.

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,540
Now, I'm going to
switch the sign here,

58
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,630
so we have-- if
I invert the log,

59
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,790
that will give a minus sign.

60
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:11,180
And I have plus u log of mr
of d plus mass of the fuel.

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,340
That's the initial
mass of the rocket.

62
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,320
Divided by just the
dry mass, and that's

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,140
equal to vr at t final.

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,170
So one of the interesting
questions that you might ask

65
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:34,580
is-- how fast should
you burn the fuel,

66
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,430
and what will that have to
do with the final speed?

67
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,530
So we can see from
this expression

68
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,290
that, if you burn the fuel for
a very long period of time--

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,220
so t final is big--
then this piece will

70
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,320
diminish the final velocity.

71
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,830
So if you want the fastest speed
after you've burned the fuel,

72
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,620
you want to burn the fuel so
that t final is as short as

73
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,430
possible.

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,830
We have the shortest
burn time, will give us

75
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,577
the largest velocity when
all the fuel has been burned.
