1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,520
So I would like to tell
you about friction today.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,910
Friction is a very
mysterious subject,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,460
because it has such simple
rules at the macroscopic scale,

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,560
and yet-- as I will
show you and tell you

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,850
a little bit about today--
very different rules

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,750
at the nanoscopic scale.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:34,125
So I would like to tell you
about friction at the nano

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:34,625
scale.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,090
So at the macro scale,
there are classic rules that

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,380
were discovered very early on.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,020
For macroscopic
objects, it was actually

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,290
Leonardo da Vinci who
found the first laws

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,010
of so-called "dry" friction.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,460
So this was da Vinci as
early as in the 15th century.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,810
And basically, he discovered
that friction depends

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,730
on the force, on the weight
of the object on the surface,

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,150
and that there's a
certain coefficient that

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,750
depends on the material.

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,810
Da Vinci did not
publish his notes.

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,060
They were just hidden in his
notebooks for a long time.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,100
And Amontons in the 17th century
rediscovered the very same laws

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,680
that da Vinci had found.

23
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,490
And these are two
very simple laws.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,509
The first law is that if
you have an object sliding

25
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,270
on a surface-- so there's a
force that you are pulling

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,080
on the object, and there's
the friction force acting

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,780
on it in the opposite
direction-- then

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,980
Amontons found that
the friction force is

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,990
proportional to
the normal force.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,158
So the normal force is
the weight of the object.

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,030
So he found that
the friction force

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,710
as a function of
normal force is just

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,430
the simple interdependence.

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,230
So if you make the
object twice as heavy,

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,310
the friction force
will be twice as large.

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,220
This makes, maybe, sense.

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,430
It agrees with our intuition
that maybe an object

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,200
twice as heavy should have
a force twice as large.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,540
The second law of friction is
much more surprising-- namely,

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,100
that if you have two
objects of the same weight--

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,150
so you have the same normal
force-- but very different

42
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,640
areas of contact, then the
friction force is the same.

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,340
So if you have a friction
force for this object--

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,110
let me call it
friction force one--

45
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,420
and the friction force
of this object-- friction

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,350
force two-- then the
friction forces are the same.

47
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,290
One equals friction force two.

48
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,490
So surprisingly,
the friction force

49
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,370
is independent of contact area.

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,870
This seems very
counter-intuitive,

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,950
because if you think of friction
as some kind of sticking,

52
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,520
some kind of effect where
two surfaces rub together,

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,180
then we might naively assume
that the larger the surface,

54
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,400
the larger the friction force.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,720
So one maybe intuition
of why this might not

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
be the case, or one
possible explanation,

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,310
is that surfaces
always have roughness.

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,920
And so the actual
contact area between two

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,180
surfaces-- so if I really
draw the surface of the object

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,140
here-- then the actual contact
area between two surfaces

61
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,520
might not be the observed area
of the macroscopic object.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,190
And so this may be one way to
explain why the friction is

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,450
independent of the area,
because it might only

64
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,892
be proportional to the actual
contact area of the system.

65
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,600
We have already
described two of the laws

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,280
of macroscopic friction.

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,750
There's a third law that was
actually discovered by Coulomb.

68
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,860
And again, this is a little
bit surprising result-- namely,

69
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,480
that for this kind of
friction, the dry friction,

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
it is independent of the
velocity of the object.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,146
So this is, for
instance, something that

72
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,540
is not true for air resistance.

73
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,200
If you drive a car,
the faster you go,

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,790
the more friction there is, the
more air resistance there is.

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,280
But if you have two surfaces
sliding on top of each other,

76
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,640
then Coulomb found
that the friction force

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,765
is independent of velocity.

78
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,150
Again, this is something
quite counter--

79
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,290
not quite, but somewhat
counter-intuitive.

80
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,820
And as I will show you
a little bit later,

81
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,330
it actually is no
longer true when

82
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,680
you look at the nano scale.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,020
Coulomb was also the first one
to distinguish static friction,

84
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,770
which is the force with
which an object resists

85
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,252
motion for a while.

86
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,460
You make the force larger
and larger, so for a while,

87
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,910
the object will stick.

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,580
And then it will start sliding.

89
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,460
So he distinguished static
friction from dynamic friction.

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,610
And because we
have this law that

91
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,310
says that the
frictional force is

92
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,730
proportional to
the normal force,

93
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,800
I will remind you of the first
law-- the friction force being

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,350
proportional to
the normal force,

95
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,645
like so-- we can define a slope.

96
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,220
So we can write
the friction force

97
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,540
as some slope, mu,
times the normal force.

98
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,970
These are both forces, so
they have the same units,

99
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,721
which means that the so-called
coefficient of friction-- which

100
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,220
could be therefore
static frictional

101
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,920
or for dynamic friction,
for kinetic friction--

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,210
this coefficient
is just a number.

103
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:30,070
And typically, this number
is between 0.3 and 0.6.

104
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,100
This makes a lot of sense.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,350
The friction force is not quite
as strong as the normal force.

106
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,520
So the friction force with
which an object resists motion

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,790
is not quite as large
as the normal force

108
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,990
with which it pushes down
on a certain surface.

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,510
However, surprisingly,
there are materials where

110
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,380
mu is actually larger than 1.

111
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,470
It's possible, for
instance, for rubber.

112
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,420
Which means that an object
can be harder to pull sideways

113
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,300
than actually-- it can be harder
to pull an object sideways

114
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,270
than to actually lift
it from the surface.

115
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,980
So this is a surprising result.

116
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,270
Now, it turns out that despite
these very simple laws,

117
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,520
our fundamental understanding
of friction is rather limited.

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,420
So for instance,
nobody in the world

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,250
can predict this
coefficient mu of friction.

120
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,670
Nobody in the world can,
from microscopic or principle

121
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,120
say-- being told what
the two surfaces are,

122
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,170
say plastic or wood-- what
is the friction coefficient.

123
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,610
Can you calculate it for me?

124
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,990
We cannot predict it.

125
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,630
We can only measure it, and then
tabulate it-- make a table--

126
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,490
and say this kind of object
on this kind of surface

127
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,920
has this kind of
coefficient for friction.

128
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,890
So that's one, if you
want, failure of physics.

129
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,730
How is it possible that we can't
describe, and quantitatively

130
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,950
describe, something
as simple as that?

131
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,100
Also, in many
instances, we would

132
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,120
like to change the
coefficient to friction.

133
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,490
Typically, we would
like to reduce friction,

134
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,000
because friction is something
where we dissipate energy.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,650
It is estimated that as much
as 3% of the nation's GDP

136
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:24,260
is "wasted" on friction.

137
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,810
So friction destroys energy
in the amount of billions

138
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,340
and billions of dollars--
cars driving on streets,

139
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,400
machines working, and so on.

140
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,308
Sometimes friction is,
of course, desirable.

141
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,240
If you want to stop
your car on the road,

142
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,600
you want friction
to actually work.

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,760
You wouldn't like to do
away with it completely.

144
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,270
But in many instances, it's
just a source of energy loss.

145
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,010
So if we could even make a
small change in the friction,

146
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,770
this would be not only
important for science,

147
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,330
but it might also be very
important for technology.

148
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,550
So here, I've told
you about friction

149
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,390
of macroscopic objects.

150
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,890
Now people-- chemists,
physicists, other scientists,

151
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,110
engineers-- are able to build
smaller and smaller machines.

152
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,230
And there's tremendous interest
to build nanoscopic machines--

153
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,210
machines that are maybe only a
few molecules or a small number

154
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,930
of molecules or
atoms wide and big.

155
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,430
And there's been
tremendous success.

156
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,210
People have built nano pumps--
tiny pumps-- even a tiny car,

157
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,810
consisting of a relatively
small number of molecules

158
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,830
that can move on the surface
if you inject the electrons.

159
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,390
So as I would like now to tell
you about how bad friction

160
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,550
is at the nano scale.

161
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,700
So let's ask the
following question--

162
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,812
how bad is friction
at the nano scale?

163
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,090
Your general intuition
might be that friction

164
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,330
gets worse at the nano scale,
simply because the bulk--

165
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,940
the volume of an
object-- is what

166
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,320
determines how many
atoms are in it,

167
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,410
whereas friction is
a surface effect.

168
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,020
And because the volume
increases more quickly

169
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,610
with the size of the object
then does the surface,

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,730
you might think that
probably, there's

171
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,780
a bigger problem with
friction at the nano scale

172
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,930
than there is for
macroscopic objects.

173
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,170
To illustrate how
bad this really is,

174
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,635
let's consider a tire of a car.

175
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,830
So this tire is rolling
as your car is driving.

176
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,990
And we can try to
estimate what happens

177
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,970
to the wear of this tire.

178
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,100
So let's say that this
tire maybe wears off.

179
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,830
Wear is on the order
of maybe, let's say,

180
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:58,870
10 millimeters every,
maybe, 50,000 kilometers.

181
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,790
So that means we take off
a number of atomic layers

182
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,640
here every 50,000 kilometers.

183
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,510
Now, how many atomic
layers is 10 millimeter?

184
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:15,140
If we say that one
atomic layer is

185
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,330
on the order of, let's call
it 1 Angstrom-- which is 10

186
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,660
to the minus 10 meters--
then 10 millimeters

187
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,870
is 10 to the minus 2 meters.

188
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,180
So that is equal--
since one layer

189
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,280
is 10 to minus 10 meters--
that is equal to 10

190
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,180
to the 8 atomic layers.

191
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:51,260
We can also ask ourself, how
far has the tire been moving?

192
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,260
So if we assume that the
circumference of the tire-- so

193
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,480
this is the radius of the tire.

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,010
Let's guess that maybe the
circumference of the tire here,

195
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,810
which is given by 2 pi r,
is on the order of 1 meter.

196
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,000
Then this means that 50,000
kilometers-- or 5 times 10

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,300
to the 7 meters, which
is 50,000 kilometers--

198
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,728
is basically 5 times 10
to the 7 revolutions.

199
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,800
So in 50 million revolutions-- 5
times 10 to the 7 revolutions--

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,690
we lose 10 to the
8 atomic layers.

201
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,760
So it comes out that we lose
one to two atomic layers

202
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,385
per revolution.

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,180
If we had used maybe
a size of an atom

204
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,730
more closely as
two Angstroms, we

205
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,930
would come out at
about one atomic layer.

206
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,100
So this is a remarkable effect.

207
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,160
Even when we drive our car,
each time the tire rolls around,

208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,289
we leave one atomic
layer on the street.

209
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,580
For a macroscopic object, as
we see, it doesn't matter.

210
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,540
We can drive a very large
macroscopic distance

211
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,330
before we wear off a few
millimeters of the tire.

212
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,930
But if the tire of
the car was itself

213
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,570
only a few atomic
layers big, then you

214
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,070
see we would have
a huge problem.

215
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,610
So this is why people are
interested in understanding,

216
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,140
and maybe manipulating,
friction at the nano scale.

217
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,360
So what does friction at the
nano scale really look like?

218
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,730
And why are people
interested in it

219
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,180
after so many centuries of
first studying friction?

220
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,410
One reason is that now
one can do experiments

221
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,348
at the nano scale.

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,190
And the new tool
that has enabled that

223
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,668
is what is called an
atomic force microscope.

224
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,520
What is an atomic
force microscope?

225
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,310
Well, it's essentially
a very, very sharp tip--

226
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,480
atomically sharp tip.

227
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,550
So you have a surface here,
which consists of atoms.

228
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,901
And these are individual atoms.

229
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,040
And you're trying to
study the friction.

230
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,400
And now what you do is, you
bring an object here shaped

231
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,850
in the form of the tip,
which also consists of atoms.

232
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,500
And the object is so
sharp that you have,

233
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,690
ideally, just one atom
near the surface-- one

234
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,480
or more atoms near the surface.

235
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,960
So this is what an atomic
force microscope is.

236
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,720
You can pull on this
with some force.

237
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,910
And then you can try to measure
the force of resistance--

238
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,810
the friction force that
is due to the interaction

239
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,940
between the atom near
the surface and the atoms

240
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,660
forming the surface.

241
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,060
So we might call
this the substrate.

242
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,460
And this would be
the moving object.

243
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,560
And we can either
study static friction

244
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
by pulling the objects, but
not with a force large enough

245
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,060
to move, or maybe we
can apply a larger force

246
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,460
so the object starts moving
at a certain velocity v,

247
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,330
and we can measure friction.

248
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,020
Now this, as simple
as it may seem,

249
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,430
is still too complicated
for physicists.

250
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,610
So we try to make the
model even simpler.

251
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,500
So how do physicists do this?

252
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,580
Well, they say that the surface
still consists of atoms,

253
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,490
but now we're mostly interested
what happens to this tip.

254
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,450
We're going to
say, well, somehow,

255
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,700
what matters is that this
atom is bound to the tip.

256
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,430
So maybe we can model
it in the following way.

257
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,200
We have here the
macroscopic part of the tip.

258
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,480
And then we're going to say
that the surface atom is really

259
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,570
bound in some way to the tip.

260
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,060
And the simplest way that we
can imagine the surface atom

261
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,070
to be bound to the
tip is via some spring

262
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,960
with some specific
spring constant.

263
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,020
So basically, the
one atom that makes

264
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,350
the contact with the
surface is bound via spring

265
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,510
to the rest of a
tip that is moving--

266
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,480
to the rest of
the moving object.

267
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,374
So this is how we view the tip
as physicists, to make a model.

268
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,540
And then how do we view the
surface to make a model?

269
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,770
Well, we say this is really
a periodic arrangement

270
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,750
of the atoms.

271
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,240
So maybe it makes
sense to kind of assume

272
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,740
that the associated
potential is also

273
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,690
periodic at the atomic scale.

274
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,560
So this is the potential
as a function of position.

275
00:16:51,560 --> 00:17:06,760
So basically, we model
friction as spring

276
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,429
plus periodic potential.

277
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,400
This is a very simple model.

278
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,550
And it was first introduced
now about 90 years ago.

279
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:28,170
So by Prandtl-- by
a German physicist

280
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,400
called Prandtl--
and independently

281
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,910
by another physicist
called Tomlinson.

282
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,070
And this is called the
Prandtl-Tomlinson model.

283
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,450
And they discovered
it, or introduced it,

284
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,577
in 1928 and 1929.

285
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:48,410
And it turns out that
this very simple model

286
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,710
of a spring and the
periodic potential

287
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,090
captures much of the
essence of nano friction.

288
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,970
So as physicists,
now we have a spring

289
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,660
and the periodic potential.

290
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,430
How do we think about this?

291
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,900
Well, one way is to think
about the energy in the system.

292
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,900
So we can plot the energy
as a function of position.

293
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,720
And now we have our
periodic potential, like so.

294
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,440
And how do we model the spring?

295
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,150
Well, this is going to be
the potential energy, v. How

296
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,360
do we model the spring?

297
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,290
Well, the spring
has a linear force.

298
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,400
The force is proportional
to the displacement,

299
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,500
which means the potential is
quadratic in this placement.

300
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,510
So this is the
potential for spring.

301
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,200
This is what the
spring does, and this

302
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,571
is what the substrate does.

303
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,160
And what we need to do is, we
need to add these two together.

304
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,780
So what that means
qualitatively is

305
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,040
that the total
potential of the system

306
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,832
might look something like this.

307
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,710
So as we now
translate the spring

308
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,930
across the surface
with some velocity,

309
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,390
then you can see
that this addition

310
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,200
between the fixed substrate
potential-- this one is fixed--

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,120
and this spring
potential is moving.

312
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,200
You can see that this will lead
to a time-varying potential

313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,520
for the object.

314
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,620
So let's look now, in a
simulation, what that time

315
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,750
variation might look like.

316
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,600
So what you see here
is a combination

317
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,192
of a spring and the
periodic potential.

318
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,650
And the periodic
potential has been

319
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,370
chosen a slightly
different strength

320
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,660
than I'm showing you here.

321
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,670
It has been chosen
weaker so that instead

322
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,340
of many minima in
this total potential,

323
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,840
there are only two minima.

324
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,610
And what you see
happening in this system

325
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,610
is that, as the
particle is moving,

326
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,900
the spring tries to
pull it across a maximum

327
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,470
of the periodic potential.

328
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,820
At some point, the
atom is released,

329
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,860
and it releases energy
that is taken up

330
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,500
as heat by the substrate.

331
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,840
And then, the object is pulled
towards the next minimum.

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,810
The minimum disappears slowly.

333
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,940
The object is released
again, et cetera.

334
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,330
So basically, in this model,
we can understand friction

335
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,140
as the external force
pulling the object

336
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,120
over successive maxima.

337
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
So that's nice.

338
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,930
In this model we can understand
why there is heat generated.

339
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,290
There's always heat
generated when the atom loses

340
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,970
this extra energy,
because it is stuck

341
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,340
for a while in a minimum
of the potential, which

342
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,510
is not the absolute
minimum of the potential.

343
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,130
And then the moment
it's released,

344
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,510
it releases kinetic energy
that is converted into heat.

345
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,490
Now we can have a
different situation.

346
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,295
So this was for strong or
moderately strong potential.

347
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,710
So basically, this
was a situation

348
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,780
where there are just two minima
in the potential, like so.

349
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,380
We can make the potential
a little bit weaker.

350
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,700
And in that case, the
curvature of this potential--

351
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,440
of the periodic potential--
the curvature in one direction

352
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,090
might not be enough to
overcome the opposite curvature

353
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,050
of the spring.

354
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,760
So in this case, we can end up
with a potential just slightly

355
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,935
distorted, but we
have only one minimum.

356
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,730
So in the next movie,
I will show you

357
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,590
what happens when we
have just one minimum.

358
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,730
In that case, you can
see that, because there

359
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,670
is no second minimum in
the system, the object--

360
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,170
in this case, the tip--
follows quite smoothly

361
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,760
the minimum of the potential.

362
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,420
And no energy is released.

363
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,630
No heat is released
in the problem.

364
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,800
This model-- this
Prandtl-Tomlinson model--

365
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,960
is interesting.

366
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,220
If in this model, we
plot the friction force

367
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,790
versus the corrugation of
the potential corrugation--

368
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,440
so we'll call this the
corrugation of the potential,

369
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,180
u, which is proportional
to the normal force

370
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,950
for a macroscopic object--
then what we find is,

371
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,020
yes, we find a
linear dependence.

372
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,360
So this is, if you
want, the corrugation

373
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,560
or the normal force.

374
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,280
What we find is a linear
dependence, but only

375
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,890
above a certain critical value.

376
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,350
So the friction force
actually looks like this.

377
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,760
It's 0 until the potential
becomes strong enough.

378
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,490
Basically, you can think of
this curvature becoming larger

379
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,070
than that curvature.

380
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,830
And then, the friction
force sets in.

381
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,333
So this is at the nano scale.

382
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,180
And our simple
macroscopic friction law

383
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,190
would have predicted
something of the same slope

384
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,170
at the macro scale--
something of the same slope

385
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,880
with a [INAUDIBLE] offset.

386
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,244
So we can kind of see
that, at the nano scale,

387
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,160
the friction is a little
bit more complicated.

388
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,770
There's a region where there's
no friction whatsoever.

389
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,530
But then it increases linearly
with the normal force.

390
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,250
So you can imagine that if I
go to macroscopic normal loads,

391
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,840
then the difference between
these curves, at least

392
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,376
fractionally, will
be quite small.

393
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,880
The difference between these
curves, at least fractionally,

394
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,170
will be quite small.

395
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,340
And so we can see how the
law of the nano scale,

396
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,320
explained by this very simple
Prandtl-Tomlinson model,

397
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,570
approaches the law
at the macro scale.

398
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,730
So far, I have told you
about something very simple--

399
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,972
namely when the contact
is a single atom.

400
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,550
And even making this very
simple approximation,

401
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,190
we can already understand
why the friction

402
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,930
force is approximately
proportional

403
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,890
to the normal force.

404
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,420
Now in real life, probably
there is more than one atom

405
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,010
touching the surface.

406
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:15,740
So let's consider a contact
area where several atoms-- maybe

407
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,950
a long chain, maybe just a few
atoms, in the case of nanoscale

408
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,110
probably just a few atoms--
several atoms will be making up

409
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,370
the contact.

410
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,350
So instead of considering
this situation

411
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:33,140
with one atom on a spring,
which is the single atom case,

412
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,340
now let's consider a situation
where several atoms make up

413
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,810
the contact.

414
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,300
So again, here we
have the substrate

415
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,430
with our periodic potential
that is ultimately coming

416
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,050
from the individual atoms.

417
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,946
But now we will consider
more than one atom making up

418
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:54,445
the surface.

419
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:05,010
So in this case, how
do we model the system?

420
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,670
Well, we think that these atoms
are still connected by springs

421
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,985
to the macroscopic object.

422
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,280
But typically, these atoms will
also have forces between them.

423
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,330
So this is my
physicist's model of what

424
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,530
happens when more than one
atom touches the surface.

425
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,690
Now these are only
masses of springs

426
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,530
and some simple
periodic potential,

427
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,880
and yet the situation is quite
complex, and in many ways,

428
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,690
counter-intuitive.

429
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,440
And the first thing that changes
compared to the single atom

430
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,780
is that now I have the
distance between the atoms

431
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,140
as a parameter.

432
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,370
So if I label the period
of the periodic potential

433
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:53,470
as a, and maybe the period
of my object of the distance

434
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,816
between the atoms
in the object as d,

435
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,730
then I can have
different situations.

436
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:07,520
So one very simple
case is when d

437
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,360
is equal to a-- when the
two periods are the same--

438
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,630
or in general, when d is
a multiple integer of a,

439
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,743
and n is an integer.

440
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,280
So let's see what
happens in this case.

441
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,390
Very naively, all the atoms
are doing the same thing

442
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,090
relative to the surface.

443
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,150
So you might expect
them, maybe, to move

444
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,710
in exactly the same way.

445
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,200
They will all move together.

446
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,220
And these springs between
them will not stretch.

447
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,020
In this case, I can
forget about the springs

448
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,880
between the atoms
in this simple case

449
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,190
that we'll call commensurate.

450
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,710
Basically, when the
period of the object

451
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,440
matches the period
of the substrate--

452
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,770
the commensurate case--
then the atoms are

453
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,870
at equivalent positions
throughout the substrate

454
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,560
period, the lattice of
the springs between them

455
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,270
will not stretch.

456
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,870
And it's as if
they are not there.

457
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,300
So in the commensurate
case, what

458
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,920
you can see here is,
as the atoms are pulled

459
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,620
across the periodic
potential, because

460
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,750
of this commensurability
condition where d is equal to a

461
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,570
or a multiple integer
of a-- basically,

462
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,830
two periods are
matched-- all the atoms

463
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,580
are doing the same
thing at the same time.

464
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,440
So they get pulled,
pulled, pulled.

465
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,960
They first stick, and then
they all slip at the same time.

466
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,380
And you can imagine-- and
you can kind of see visually

467
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,310
in this case-- that
the friction is

468
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,940
the same as the single atom
friction multiplied simply

469
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,890
by n.

470
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,070
So this is just the
single atom friction

471
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,560
that we have seen
before multiplied

472
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,242
by just the number of atoms
that makes up the contact area.

473
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,080
Now there's a
different case, which

474
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:04,960
we might call incommensurate,
where d is not equal to a,

475
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,900
and d is not an
integer multiple of a.

476
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,380
So maybe d could be 1.5 a, or
2/3 of a, or some other number.

477
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,310
And what is the most
incommensurate case

478
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,630
that we can imagine?

479
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,070
Well, the most incommensurate
case for d and a

480
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,716
is that the ratio of d and
a is an irrational number.

481
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,940
So an irrational number
would be something

482
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,510
like square root of 2,
or for our purposes,

483
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,930
it turns out that the
most irrational number

484
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,030
in a mathematical sense is
1/2 squared of 5 plus 1.

485
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,560
This is the so-called
Golden Ratio.

486
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,530
The ancient Greeks believed
that it had magical properties.

487
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,670
For instance, when they
built the temples, the two

488
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,710
sides of the temples-- the
two sides of the rectangle--

489
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,830
were related by this
very strange number,

490
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,430
the so-called Golden Ratio.

491
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,956
It is assumed to be
aesthetically very pleasing.

492
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,830
Now mathematically
speaking, the Golden Ratio

493
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,750
is very interesting, because it
is the most irrational number,

494
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,560
in some sense, that
you can devise.

495
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,770
Now we can choose such
an incommensurate ratio

496
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,783
of d over a, and see what
happens in this case.

497
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,640
So you can see here
that, in the case

498
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,480
of an incommensurate ratio,
the behavior of the transport--

499
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,230
the behavior of the
motion of the object--

500
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,710
changes dramatically.

501
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,320
Instead of all the atoms
sticking and slipping together,

502
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,570
like we had in the
commensurate case,

503
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,040
now the atoms move one by one.

504
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,180
Basically, the first atom moves
over the barrier, the spring

505
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,500
stretches, which
facilitates the motion

506
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,020
of the next atom over the
barrier, the next atom,

507
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,960
and so on.

508
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,590
So these atom chains
move like a caterpillar.

509
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,390
They essentially
move one by one.

510
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,011
In technical language, we
call these things kinks.

511
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,010
You can see that they are
periodic compressions.

512
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,140
They are compressions
in the chain

513
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,840
and stretches in the chain.

514
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,700
And so these atoms move
like a caterpillar.

515
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,370
And now an interesting
fact is that in this case,

516
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,353
friction is
dramatically reduced.

517
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,640
And depending on
which regime you are,

518
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,040
the friction can even disappear
altogether at the nano scale.

519
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,680
The reduction was so large
that some people have even

520
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,020
coined this with the
word superlubricity.

521
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,440
Interestingly enough, even
though this is a very simple

522
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,570
system, it's just, if you
want, balls and springs,

523
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,760
this superlubricity was only
discovered in the late 1980s,

524
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,130
even though we know
all the physics

525
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,170
for more than a century.

526
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,580
So you can see just a tiny, tiny
rearrangement of the atoms--

527
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,010
not to be any more
commensurate with the lattice,

528
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,810
but to be
incommensurate in terms

529
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,180
of an irrational number--
can change friction

530
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,560
properties dramatically.

531
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,900
In fact, there was
a French scientist

532
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,900
called Aubry that
first pointed out

533
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,690
that there's a very interesting
transition that happens

534
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,000
in this system of a
periodic potential

535
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,160
and atoms connected with springs
when you choose, as the ratio

536
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,470
between these two length
scales, the Golden Ratio.

537
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,900
And this is called
the Aubry Transition.

538
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,100
So far, we have
considered only, if you

539
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,830
want, the mechanics
of the motion, which

540
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,710
is equivalent to saying that we
have assumed that the system is

541
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,360
at temperature T equal 0.

542
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,430
Basically, the atoms
remains at the minimum.

543
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,610
It doesn't wiggle around
because of temperature,

544
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,910
and we have derived the
friction in this limit.

545
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:18,830
Now what happens for
finite temperature--

546
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,550
by finite, meaning a temperature
that is larger than 0.

547
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,970
Well, if you think back of
our simple single-atom model

548
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,980
of friction, where maybe
an atom is stuck here

549
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,940
as the potential is moving
with some velocity v,

550
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,550
then in the 0 temperature
limit, this atom

551
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,420
would only be released at the
time when this minimum actually

552
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,220
disappears.

553
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,740
And then it would
have a high energy

554
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,530
and it would
dissipate this energy

555
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,530
to be cooled to
the next minimum.

556
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,220
However, if we have a
finite temperature T--

557
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,520
some temperature
scale T-- that means

558
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,810
that the energy of the atom
in the potential is not 0,

559
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,050
the kinetic energy.

560
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,200
But the atom has a
smeared-out kinetic energy

561
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,050
and potential energy
that is like so.

562
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,460
So what that means is that the
atom can [INAUDIBLE] hop over

563
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,820
the barrier and find the new
minimum, without actually

564
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,820
having to be pulled
over this maximum.

565
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,230
So what we expect is
that temperature effect

566
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,540
might reduce friction.

567
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:30,222
So people call this
thermolubricity-- the effect

568
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,680
that when you heat
up the surface--

569
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,263
and in many instances, you would
have to substantially heat up

570
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,720
the surface-- then
friction is reduced,

571
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,730
because the atom can find the
new minimum of the potential

572
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,070
without actually having to
be pulled over the barrier.

573
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,990
So let's see in a
small simulation what

574
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,890
that might look like.

575
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:49,070
What you see here
is now that the atom

576
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,047
has a chance of hopping between
the two minima, back and forth.

577
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,630
And it has a certain
probability to be

578
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,580
found at either one
of the two minima,

579
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,840
which is indicated by the
size of the red circle,

580
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,860
in this case.

581
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,580
So you can see that when
temperature is present,

582
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,720
then the atom can follow
the minimum locally--

583
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,770
the absolute global
minimum-- simply because it

584
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,050
can hop back and forth
between the barrier

585
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,340
without actually
experiencing much friction.

586
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,270
So in particular in the limit
when the temperature is very,

587
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,370
very high, or the
velocity of the atom

588
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,310
is very, very low, then the
atom with hop many times back

589
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,010
and forth between
the two minima.

590
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,500
And the distribution
between the two minima

591
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,739
would be simply given by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

592
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,790
which means that the atom
will be predominantly found

593
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,969
in the global minimum.

594
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:38,360
And they'll just be
following the potential along

595
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:46,199
and the friction in this
system will be quite small.

596
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:51,340
So in this case, if we do
a measurement of friction

597
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,010
versus velocity in a
simulator-- that we do,

598
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,020
then this is what the
result might look like,

599
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,220
or what the result
does look like.

600
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,390
We see here different
ranges of friction.

601
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,350
We see a range where
the friction does not

602
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,360
depend on velocity at all.

603
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,540
Friction is 0.

604
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,880
Then there's a range where
the friction increases

605
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,490
with velocity, but only
very weakly logarithmically.

606
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,790
Please notice that this
is a logarithmic scale

607
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,190
for the velocity.

608
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,170
So the velocity here changes
over five orders of magnitude.

609
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,280
So friction increases
with increasing velocity.

610
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,110
Then there's a
range of frictions

611
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,090
actually independent
of velocity,

612
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,320
just like the simple
macroscopic law would predict.

613
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,062
And then it turns out when you
move the atom very, very fast,

614
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,520
then it basically
doesn't have time

615
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,090
to dissipate all the energy.

616
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,020
And friction is reduced
again, effectively,

617
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,690
because the atom is hotter.

618
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,620
So we can see that the simple
macroscopic law of friction

619
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,770
only applies in a region,
which in this experiment

620
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,210
was relatively narrow, of
relatively low temperatures.

621
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,750
So let's summarize what happens
to the loss at the macro scale.

622
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,910
So the first law
at the macro scale

623
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,740
was that the friction
force was proportional

624
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,750
to the normal force.

625
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,730
And we found that at the nano
scale, actually what happens

626
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,760
is a displaced
curve, where there

627
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,380
is no friction in
a certain region,

628
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,080
and then the friction follows
parallel to the macro results.

629
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,690
So this would be the actual
friction at the nano scale.

630
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,090
And we see that it's a
fairly good approximation

631
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,330
to the macroscopic friction,
but with a small offset.

632
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:44,440
Our second law of
friction was that friction

633
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:57,060
is independent of surface
area, of contact area--

634
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,420
basically, the idea
that a high object

635
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,210
and a flat object
of the same mass

636
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,830
experience the same friction.

637
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,360
And we see that
at the nano scale,

638
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,730
it's replaced by a much
more complicated law that

639
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,162
depends on the arrangement of
the atoms, or on, if you want,

640
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:18,870
commensurability.

641
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,330
so we have non-equivalent
arrangements

642
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,090
of the atoms that
can either lead

643
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,830
to large or small friction.

644
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,410
And somehow, the
macroscopic law is some kind

645
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,340
of average over these behaviors,
if we allow for randomness

646
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,370
in the positions
of the surfaces.

647
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,990
And finally, our third law--
that at the macroscopic scale,

648
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:54,400
friction is independent
of velocity--

649
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:03,370
we found at the nano scale
that this can be true,

650
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:19,730
but it is generally true only in
some finite temperature range--

651
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,910
namely, that if you move the
object very, very slowly,

652
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,910
then thermal excitations
allow you to always find

653
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,790
the global minimum, and
friction disappears-- the effect

654
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,610
called thermolubricity.

655
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,580
So one can see that there
are nice connections

656
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,570
between the nano scale
and the macro scale.

657
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,630
But many open questions
remain, in particular,

658
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,030
concerning the
point two, which is

659
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,670
that the friction is
independent of the contact area.

660
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,120
What does the
contact area really

661
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,090
look like for two
macroscopic objects?

662
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,490
And how is it that this
independence on the surface

663
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,540
area-- or at least on the
apparent contact area--

664
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,160
actually arises from the
properties of friction

665
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,310
at the nano scale?
