1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,780
Let's consider a
gravitational slingshot.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,010
What is that?

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,300
Well, once in a while, people
like to send spacecrafts out

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,370
into the solar
system, particularly

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,620
the outer solar system, to
explore what's going on there.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,050
And because we can't on
Earth give enough speed

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,770
to these little spacecrafts, we
need the big planets around us

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,880
to help us a little.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,030
And so we can consider a large
planet like Jupiter or Saturn.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,860
Here we have Saturn.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,290
And if we have a
little spacecraft

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,110
and we make it fly by close,
then what actually happens

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,080
is it will, due to the
gravitational attraction

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,420
of Saturn, acquire
a kick in velocity.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,300
And that is a
gravitational slingshot.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,180
So let's look at that.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,080
So our little spacecraft comes
in with an initial velocity.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,180
And Saturn, of course,
also has a velocity.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,620
And once it has passed,
our little spacecraft

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,430
will have a final velocity.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,030
And in order to calculate what
this final velocity is going

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,850
to be, what the increase
in speed is going to be,

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,160
we need the concept
of relative velocity.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,789
And for that, we need to first
consider some initial state.

25
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:35,690
So we have the relative
velocity initially.

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,400
And that is the difference
between those two velocities,

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,811
between the
spacecraft and Saturn.

28
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,310
And what becomes
very important here

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,420
is that we look at
the coordinate system.

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,650
And keep that in mind.

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,650
Otherwise, we're going
to get a few sign errors.

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,090
So the initial velocity
of the spacecraft

33
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,830
goes in the i hat direction.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,926
And the velocity--
the relative velocity

35
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,300
is, of course,
the difference, so

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,180
minus the velocity of Saturn.

37
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,240
But that one goes in the
minus i hat direction.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,710
And then we have
the final state.

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,940
So V final relative.

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,590
And here we have
the final velocity

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,170
of the spacecraft now
going in the minus i hat

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,040
direction minus the
velocity of Saturn

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,520
that also goes in the
minus i hat direction.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,910
Now, there is one thing
that we need to consider,

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,370
which is this
velocity of Saturn.

46
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,200
This one actually
is, of course, here,

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,220
the initial velocity of Saturn,
and this one is the final one.

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,190
But because the
mass of Saturn is

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,730
much larger than the
mass of the spacecraft,

50
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,750
we can actually set the
initial velocity of Saturn

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,460
to the final velocity of Saturn.

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,180
So we can turn this-- we can
take this away here again,

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,040
and just consider one
velocity of Saturn.

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,830
OK, good.

55
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,820
There's one more thing that we
need in order to solve this,

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,330
because we need to know how
the relative velocities are

57
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,860
actually related.

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,780
And the energy momentum
law helps us there,

59
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,050
because that gives us that
the initial relative velocity

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,000
equals minus the final
relative velocity.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,840
OK, so we can plug that in now.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
What do we have here for
the initial velocity?

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:39,329
We have Vi minus two i's gives
us a plus the Saturn velocity.

64
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,390
And that equals--
minus minus gives us a

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,230
plus-- the final velocity
of the spacecraft.

66
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,180
And then we have
three minuses here,

67
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,760
so that gives us a minus
the Saturn velocity.

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,890
And we know from the problem
that the initial velocity here

69
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,750
of the spacecraft
was actually given

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,520
at three Saturn velocities.

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,890
So we can tally this up now.

72
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,820
We have three-- we have
three plus one is four.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,940
And we'll put this
over on the other side.

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,310
That gives us five.

75
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,170
Five Saturn velocities
equals our final velocity.

76
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,370
So that's quite a good
gain, I would say.

77
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,630
And it nicely illustrates
why big planets like Jupiter

78
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,210
and Saturn are really, really
helpful for the exploration

79
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,980
of the solar system.

80
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,480
And that is actually how the
New Horizons mission made it out

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,590
to Pluto, all the way out there.
