00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.460
We begin with multiplication
of a vector by a scalar.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
When you multiply a
vector, A, by a scalar,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.490
this multiplicative factor
just rescales the magnitude

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.040
or the length of the vector.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.130
Let us look at
the vector 2 times

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.190
A. This is in the same
direction as the vector A,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.000
but is twice as long.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.250
This is vector B.
A vector is defined

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.170
by its magnitude and direction.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.900
So this vector B is the
same anywhere in space,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.870
including at the origin.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.250
If I want minus 0.5
times B, this vector

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.020
is in the opposite direction
of B and is half the length.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.610
Now let's look at
vector addition.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.290
Here's a vector A. Here is B.
How do we add them graphically?

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.765
We slide the tail of
B to the head of A.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.860
And their sum is a vector
drawn from the tail of A

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.670
to the head of B. I could
have also added A to B

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.539
by sliding the tail
of A to the head of B.

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.340
You can see that this
makes a parallelogram,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.699
and the sum, vector C,
is just the diagonal

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:16.615
of this parallelogram.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.490
Subtraction can be thought
of as just multiplication

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.380
and addition.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.289
If I have C is
equal to A minus B,

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.900
I just need to add A to
the vector minus B. Minus B

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.740
is negative 1 times B,
which is this vector here.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.090
Now I only have to
add A to minus B.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.490
Let's do another example.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.410
Here are my vectors A and B
do not start at the origin.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.680
But since vectors are the
same anywhere in space,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.280
I can go through
the process here.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.670
I want A minus B. So I
first multiply B by minus 1

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.140
to find minus B. And then
I move the tail of minus B

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.280
to the head of A and
add the two like this.
