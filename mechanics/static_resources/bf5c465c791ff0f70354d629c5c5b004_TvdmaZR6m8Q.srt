1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,610
I'd now like to consider
a very unusual problem,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,660
and we saw a demo of this.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,510
Suppose you have a yoyo,
and the yoyo an inner radius

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,140
b and an outer radius
R. And the yoyo

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,645
is rolling without
slipping along the ground.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,880
And what we have here is
we're pulling the yoyo

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,640
with a string that's
wrapped around the spool,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,002
and I want to find F max such
that it rolls without slipping.

9
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,710
If I don't pull it
hard enough, the wheel

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,630
will roll without slipping.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,230
And if I pull it
harder, then this F max,

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,360
the wheel will start to slip.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,900
So now let's analyze
this problem,

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,930
and let's use our
dynamics approach.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,540
Let's choose an i
hat, a j hat, k hat.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,280
As before, we'll
define an angle theta.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,420
And now we'll apply
both Newton's second law

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,850
for linear motion and our
torque about the center of mass.

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,270
Now, we have to
consider our forces.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,310
So I'm going to put the
forces on this diagram.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,360
We have the normal force
from the ground pointing up.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
We have the gravitational
force pointing down.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,860
And remember, it's
rolling without slipping.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,980
So the wheel is--

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,860
the contact point is
instantaneously at rest.

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,310
But because the center
of mass of the wheel

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,970
is accelerating, once again,
in order to keep a equal to R

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,300
alpha, then we need
some type of torque

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,590
that will produce
a non-zero alpha.

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,330
And that's going to come from
a non-zero static friction.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,410
So once again, we have a case,
unlike a wheel which is just

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,120
rolling along a
horizontal plane,

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,789
because we're pulling
this yoyo's string,

34
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,740
the static friction is not 0.

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,380
Static friction depends
on everything else

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,390
that's happening in the system.

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,070
And now we can apply Newton's
second law, F equals ma.

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:16,045
And so in our x direction,
we have F minus F equals ma.

39
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:21,160
And if we look at the torque
about the center of mass

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,680
is Icm alpha.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,079
Then this is our x equation.

42
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,410
Now here, both the pulling
force and the static friction

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,380
both exert torques about
the center of mass.

44
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,520
The static friction will exert
a torque in the direction k hat,

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,920
and the pulling force will exert
a torque in the minus k hat

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,190
direction.

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,270
So our torques--
the normal force

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,970
does not produce any torque
about the center of mass,

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,930
nor does gravity.

50
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,150
So what we have is fs times
the radius of the wheel--

51
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,910
that is the torque due
to static friction--

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,010
minus b times the
pulling force F,

53
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,190
and that's equal to Icm alpha.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,330
So we have our two
dynamic equations.

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,440
And again, let's
recopy our rolling

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,050
without slipping
condition, now expressed

57
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,190
in terms of acceleration.

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,400
So now what I'd
like to do is solve

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,030
for this force F.
And the way I'll do

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,230
it is I'll write down,
from this condition, alpha

61
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,160
in terms of a/R. And from
this equation, I have that--

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,110
so alpha is a/R. And
from the top equation,

63
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,030
I have that a is F minus
f static over mR, times R.

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,329
So I can replace the
alpha in this equation,

65
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:04,900
and I get fsR minus bF is
Icm F minus fs over mR.

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,840
And now I just need
to collect terms.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,430
I'll bring the static friction
term to this side and my f term

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,750
to that side.

69
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,950
And so I get fs
times R. And when

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,930
I bring the static friction
term over to that other side,

71
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,920
I get Icm over mR.

72
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,930
Let's just check dimensions.

73
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,180
Icm is mR squared.

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,210
So these terms have the
dimensions of length,

75
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,070
so looks like I'm OK.

76
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,130
And now I bring the
F to the other side,

77
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,860
and I get F times b plus Icm
over mR. I can now solve for F,

78
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,500
and I get f static
R plus Icm m/R--

79
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,990
it's a complicated answer--

80
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,350
divided by b plus
Icm divided by mR.

81
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,670
Now, if I want to ask
the question, what

82
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,050
is the maximum force I can
pull in which it just slips,

83
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,660
what's physically happening
is the harder I pull,

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,640
the bigger the
static friction is.

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,710
I pull harder, static
friction gets bigger.

86
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,780
I pull harder, static
friction gets bigger.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,680
But static friction can
only have a maximum value.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,550
That hasn't changed.

89
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,030
The maximum value
of static friction

90
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,850
is the coefficient of
static friction times

91
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,950
a normal force,
which, in this case,

92
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,580
is just normal balance
in gravity, mg.

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,030
So this is the maximum value
that static friction can have.

94
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,250
And so now I get F max--

95
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,770
this is, again, a little
complicated-- mu s mg times R

96
00:05:46,770 --> 00:06:01,250
plus Icm divided by mR divided
by b plus Icm divided by mR.

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,000
And that is the
maximum force that I

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,940
can pull this yoyo with that it
still rolls without slipping.
