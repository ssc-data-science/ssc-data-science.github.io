1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,290
We previously
discussed the concept

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,600
of conservation of momentum.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,119
We will soon see that there
is another very powerful

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,490
conservation principle
in physics called

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,500
the conservation of energy.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,930
It states that there is a
certain quantity called energy

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,600
that remains unchanged
in the system

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,020
except for any that flows
in or out of the system.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,180
It's hard to say
exactly what energy is.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,950
It's an abstract quantity that
we count up in a certain way.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,750
When calculating the
energy of a system,

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,540
we must keep careful
track of any energy that

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,820
enters or leaves the system.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,620
There are also a number
of different forms

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,370
of energy-- kinetic energy,
gravitational energy,

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,180
elastic energy, electrical
energy, heat energy,

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,570
and others.

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,830
Each of these has its own
formula for calculation.

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,830
If you sum all these
energies up for a system,

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,380
the total will remain
unchanged except for what

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,930
goes in and comes out.

22
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,510
It turns out that using
energy rather than force,

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,390
one can construct a
complete system of mechanics

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,420
that is fully equivalent
to the Newtonian system.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,970
This was done by
Lagrange and Hamilton.

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,950
And you may encounter
their system in the future,

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,430
if you take more advanced
courses in physics.

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,340
However, even in the
Newtonian system,

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,470
energy remains a useful concept.

30
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,020
This week, we will
discuss kinetic energy,

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,900
the energy associated
with the motion of a mass,

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,880
and also the concept
of work, which

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,640
allows us to calculate
how the action of a force

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,770
changes the kinetic energy.

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,990
We will see that the
work done by a force

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,930
is calculated by
evaluating an integral that

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,130
in general depends upon the
specific trajectory or path

38
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,330
taken by the object or system.

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,300
However, we will also
see that there [? is ?]

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,960
a special class of forces called
conservative forces for which

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,820
the work integral
is path independent

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,030
and instead depends only on
the starting and ending points.

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,700
Finally, we will
discuss examples

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,775
of both conservative and
non-conservative forces.
