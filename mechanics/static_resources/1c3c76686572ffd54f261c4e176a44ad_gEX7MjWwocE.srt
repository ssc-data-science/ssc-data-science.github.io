1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,750
The little prince's
asteroid B612

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,400
is being orbited
by a small body.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,360
It has a mass m.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:21,840
And it goes around this asteroid
B612 that has a mass m1.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,520
We should add a
coordinate system.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,140
We always know about r-hat
goes radially outward.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,800
And we know from the
universal law of gravitation

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,470
that we have mutual attraction
between these bodies.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,255
And actually, that's
going to point inward.

10
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:41,060
And because we're having
orbital motion here,

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,020
so circular motion,
the acceleration,

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,840
the radial component
of the acceleration

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
will also point inward.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,320
We need to consider all of that
for our f equals ma analysis

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,000
that we are going to do now,
because the little prince wants

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,510
to know how far this little
body is away from his asteroid.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,450
So we have the gravitational
universal law here,

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:19,090
minus Gmm1 over the
distance squared.

19
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,950
So the distance here
between the two planets,

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,400
r, which is what we
want to calculate.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,890
And then we have over
here for circular motion,

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,720
the description of
mr omega squared.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,700
Now, the little prince
can't measure omega.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,100
But the little prince
has a little time clock.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,130
So what he can measure
is the period from here

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,520
until he sees the body again.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,200
And that is 2pi over omega.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,145
So we can add that in here.

29
00:01:55,145 --> 00:02:02,120
mr 4pi squared over T squared.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,335
And this m here will cancel out.

31
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,169
And we have to solve this for r.

32
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,240
What we're going to see--

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Oh and of course,
we have a minus sign

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,460
here because in the life
of the little prince,

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,250
of course gravitational
acceleration

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,480
is not going outwards.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,890
It's going inward, so we better
give this a minus here and here

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,130
as well.

39
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,490
And we will actually
see that that then

40
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,090
cancels out against this one.

41
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,460
And we're going to
solve this for r.

42
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,920
So we get r cubed, actually.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:47,340
And then we have Gm1
over 4pi squared.

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,540
And here, we have T squared.

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,950
And you can also just write that
as Gm1 or pi squared T squared.

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,640
And then we have third root.

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,590
So you might have seen
this equation here.

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,480
This is actually Kepler's law.

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,240
It describes the motion of
the planets around the sun.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,640
Well, it really only
does it if the motions

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,970
are fairly circular.

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,970
For elliptical orbits, it is
not such a good approximation,

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,480
although Kepler derived it
like that quite a while ago.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,329
And that was really
an astonishing result.

55
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,690
So here, we have this
again that the cube

56
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,900
of the distance
between two objects

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,280
is proportional to the square
of the period of the orbiting

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,829
time.
