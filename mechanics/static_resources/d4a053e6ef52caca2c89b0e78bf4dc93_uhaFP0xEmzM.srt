1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,530
And now I'm in position
to talk about what

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,650
is the maximum force.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,810
If I push F harder, as if I push
F and the blocks go together,

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,480
the accelerations are the same.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,900
I push F harder.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,460
Accelerations are the same.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,650
I push F harder, and
I push F so hard,

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,580
that the static friction
no longer reaches

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,580
its maximum value.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,800
And if I push F
harder than that,

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,210
I will not have--
the static friction

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,880
can't get bigger, and the
blocks 1 and 2 will start

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,290
to slip relative to each other.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:53,080
So my no slipping condition
is that I want two things.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,020
a1 equals a2.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,456
We'll call that a.

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:06,730
And the maximum force
condition is that F static

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,050
is equal to maximum value.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:19,380
Now, what is the normal force
between that we refer to

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,600
in our fiction law?

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,480
There's two normal
forces-- the ground

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,740
and the normal force
between the surfaces.

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,250
But the static friction
that we're talking about

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,230
is between the surfaces.

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,430
So that's why we use N
here and not N ground.

26
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,520
And now I can solve
for this F max.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,690
By the way, we also have the
condition that fk is mu k.

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,280
What normal force
are we talking about?

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,830
N, which we've
called N ground 1.

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,020
And now I look at my
equations, and my goal

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,460
is to solve for F. I know
Ng1 from this equation.

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,169
It's just equal to M1g plus N.
I Know N from that equation.

33
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,600
So Ng1 is just the sum
of the masses times g.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,570
So I know this.

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,904
I have f, which is m2a.

36
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:24,550
And I can now apply my result.

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,740
So what we'll do is we'll solve
for the a's, a1 equals a2,

38
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,070
in terms of F max.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:39,990
So over here we have
that a is f over m2.

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,360
That's from this equation.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,650
And now I'll substitute
a1 is equal to that.

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,990
I'll substitute that there.

43
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,579
And I get that F
Max is going to be

44
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,133
equal to fk plus f static max.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
That's that one.

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:16,460
Plus m1 times a1, which is
f static max divided by m2.

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,970
And so I get that
F max equals-- now

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,230
I'm going to substitute
in all of these values.

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,590
It's going to look a
little complicated.

50
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,070
And so I'd like to have a
little space here for that,

51
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,520
to get everything in here.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:49,870
And we'll see that it's equal
to mu k m1 plus m2g, fk, mu k,

53
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,770
plus m1 2mg plus f static max
times 1 plus and m1 over m2.

54
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,860
But f static max is
mu N, and N is m2g.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,980
So I get m2g times
1 plus m1 over m2.

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,110
And there is, if I push
any harder than that,

57
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,350
block 2 will slip with
respect to block 1.

58
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,050
Again, all of our terms have
the dimensions of acceleration.

59
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,110
This is dimensionless-- 1,
dimensions of acceleration.

60
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,150
And we did miss
one little thing.

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,820
We missed the coefficient
of static friction.

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,680
And there we have
it, a tricky problem.
