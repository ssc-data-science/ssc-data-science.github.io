1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,660
We will now like to generalize
the work energy theorem

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,490
to more than one dimension.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,850
Remember that we defined
our work as an integral

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,130
from a to b of a force dot ds.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,370
And graphically
let's look at that.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,450
If we start at A and
we go to a point B, ,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,310
and if at some point on
this path we have a force F,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,640
and the displacement is
always tangent to the force

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,740
for an object M, we would like
to now figure out how this

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,100
integral is related to the
change in kinetic energy.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,610
So first off, it's
always important

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,430
when analyzing a new
result to understand where

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,230
Newton's second law comes in.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,870
And for our point particle
Newton's second law

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,750
is that the force
is equal to ma,

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,930
which we can write as mass times
the derivative of the velocity.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,250
And so our first step is to
rewrite the work integral

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,320
and now to incorporate Newton's
second law into this integral.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,690
So this is no longer
simply a concept of physics

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,110
but it's combining the second
law and our definition of work.

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,530
Now what I'd like to
do here is to note

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,460
that the displacement
of a particle

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,160
is always equal to
the velocity times dt.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:40,500
So if we put that result in
here, AB of M dv dt dot v dt,

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,539
you can see that we can cancel
dt's, which is essentially

26
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,450
taking the time out
of this integral

27
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,479
and writing the work
entirely in terms

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,910
of the small change in
velocity, dv, scalar product

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,500
with the velocity.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,220
And this is the quantity we
would now like to calculate.

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,120
So one way, when we ever want
to calculate these dot products,

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,050
we choose a coordinate system.

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,470
So let's choose a Cartesian
coordinate system,

34
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,320
plus x plus y, with our unit
vectors i-hat and j-hat.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,329
Now our task is to write
down these various vectors.

36
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:25,410
So for instance,
dv can be written

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,100
as dv x i-hat plus dv y j-hat.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,470
Now if we were to go
into three dimensions

39
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,780
we would have dv z
k-hat but I'm just

40
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,090
going to do this
in two dimensions.

41
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,250
Similarly, the velocity
is vx i-hat plus vy j-hat.

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,050
And now when we take
the dot product,

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,490
as we've learned in
Cartesian coordinates,

44
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,710
it's just the
components dv x vx,

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,750
and I'll just do a
little parentheses there,

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,580
plus dv y vy.

47
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,320
And so now, our
work integral, AB,

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:24,450
is equal to the mass times dv x
vx plus the mass times dv y vy.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,320
Now what we have here is to
a sum in the [? integrant. ?]

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,750
But by the rules
of integration we

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,250
can rewrite this integral as
two separate integrals from A

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:50,370
to B of M dv x vx and
from A to B of M dv y vy.

53
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,850
And now we can integrate
each of these separately.

54
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,530
And if you recall,
in one dimension

55
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,820
we used our integral formula,
this is just vx squared.

56
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,330
And when we integrate them
what we have to look at

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,300
is the end points
of our integral.

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,590
What we're integrating
is a velocity,

59
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,290
and we're going from
some initial value

60
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,910
to some final value.

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,980
So our first integral simply
becomes M vx final squared.

62
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:27,570
I'll pull out the factor 2 minus
vx initial squared, where A vx

63
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,990
initial is the initial x
component velocity of A

64
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,840
in vx final is the
final component of B.

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,330
And I have a similar
term here, which

66
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,490
is vy final squared minus
the vy initial squared.

67
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,100
And when I combine
our terms, vx final

68
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,960
squared plus vy final
squared minus one-half M

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,280
vx initial squared plus
vy initial squared.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,016
We've already shown that
our kinetic energy, 1/2 M v

71
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:13,660
dot v is 1/2 M vx
squared plus vy squared.

72
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,110
And so we see that this is
just the final kinetic energy

73
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,040
minus the initial
kinetic energy.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,450
And so we can call that delta k.

75
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,050
And what we have now is
the work energy theorem.

76
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,600
And I'll come back to
my original statement

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,810
that the work is equal to
the change in kinetic energy.

78
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,590
And this is a combination
of our definition of work

79
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,171
and Newton's second law.
