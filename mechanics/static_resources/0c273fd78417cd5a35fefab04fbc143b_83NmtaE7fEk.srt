1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,270
One of the most common motions
we see in our everyday lives

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,820
is the path of an
object moving thrown

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,870
and moving through space.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,220
Now, this type of motion
has a very famous name

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,160
called projectile motion.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,600
And when we look at it, let's
introduce a coordinate system.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,270
i hat and j hat.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,080
Here's our y plus y-axis
and our plus x-axis.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,150
Then, in order to understand
the kinematics of this motion,

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,380
we'd like to apply
Newton's second law.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,670
So separately we'll
draw our object.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,990
It has gravitational
force acting downward.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,290
Remember our unit vectors
in the j hat direction.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,890
And so when we write
our equations of motion,

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,880
f equals ma.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,800
We have two
different directions.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,070
In the j hat direction, we
have the gravitational force

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,100
downward minus mg.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,710
And remember here that g is our
positive quantity, 9.8 meters

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,380
per second, and we have m a y.

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,160
Newton's second law equates
these two different things.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,980
And that's-- we'll
write it like that.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,140
So those two
quantities are equal.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,730
And so our conclusion
is that the acceleration

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,090
is equal to minus g
in the y direction.

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,920
Now, likewise, keep
in mind that we

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,330
have our horizontal
direction as well.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,979
And notice that we're
now assuming that there's

29
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,440
no horizontal forces.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,630
In the real world, there can be
all types of air resistances.

31
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,860
But here, for the
simplicity of this model,

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,670
we have no horizontal forces.

33
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,160
So we have 0 equals m a x.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,820
And so we have our separate
equation, a x equals 0.

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,080
Now, both of these equations
are equations that we've already

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,950
been working with in kinematics.

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,759
Here we have a
constant acceleration,

38
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,500
and here we have
zero acceleration.

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,150
So using the results that we
had earlier from integration,

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,020
we can write down the
equations of motion

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,610
in the y and the x directions.

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,020
First, we'll write the velocity.

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,579
Vy as a function of time is
equal to some initial value.

44
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,329
And because the acceleration
is negative, minus gt.

45
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:25,540
You can test your integration
technique to see that.

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,490
And the position as
a function of time,

47
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,880
remember, is just
some constant value.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,390
This is our constant y nought.

49
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:42,340
And we have plus vy nought
t minus 1/2 gt squared again

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,980
doing integration.

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,620
Now, the horizontal
equation of motion,

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,510
the x(t), because there
is no acceleration

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,170
in the horizontal
direction, this

54
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,130
is a constant value given by the
initial value of the component

55
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,400
of the velocity
in the x direction

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,260
and the position x(t) is then
equal to some initial position

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,190
plus Vx nought t.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,930
And so those are our
functions of time

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,160
for the components
of the velocity

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,680
and the components of position.

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,780
Now, for our particular
example, it's much easier.

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,560
Here we have X
nought equal to 0.

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,180
Notice that our object is
starting at the origin.

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,579
And so that tells us that
x as a function of time

65
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,150
is just Vx nought t.

66
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,910
I'm dropping the parentheses t.

67
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,620
Remember, that's not a product.

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,970
That's just a function of time.

69
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,210
And given this
fact, that tells us

70
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,522
that t is x divided
by Vx nought,

71
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:51,079
and now I can take
this value of t

72
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,850
and put it into our
vertical equation

73
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:02,230
and I get V y is some initial
value plus V y nought x over Vx

74
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,520
nought, substituting
for t, minus 1/2 gx

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,450
squared over V x nought squared.

76
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,500
When we described
projectile motion,

77
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,720
we had an equation describing
y as a function of t,

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,140
an equation describing
x as a function

79
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,430
of t-- the horizontal motion
and the vertical motion--

80
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,130
and here we have a
separate equation,

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,960
which is describing the
y as a function of x.

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,159
Notice there is no time
involved in this equation.

83
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,980
Now, let's try to
look at graphically

84
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,480
what we're seeing here.

85
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,280
So, for instance, when we look
at a plot of the motion of y

86
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,540
versus x, we can see the
vertical component going

87
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,850
up and down and we can see the
horizontal component moving

88
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,100
to the right while the object
is following this trajectory.

89
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,530
And this is a
parabolic trajectory

90
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,870
of y as a function of x.

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,790
Now, if we wanted to actually
plot out y as a function of t,

92
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,180
then here we can look
at the simulation

93
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,830
where we're just looking
at the y component

94
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,970
and you can see that that
motion too is a parabola.

95
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,700
However, what's
crucial to look at is

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,750
that it's y as a function of t
and not y as a function of x.

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,060
Finally, we can look at
the horizontal motion

98
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,010
and again recall that when we
looked at the trajectory as y

99
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,980
as a function of x, you can
see the horizontal motion

100
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,730
component.

101
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,600
Let's plot that separately,
x as a function of t.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,460
And when we make
that plot, you can

103
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,610
see that this is just a
linear equation in time

104
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,550
where there is some
initial condition,

105
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,510
x nought, and so that's the
plot of x as a function of t.

106
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,470
And so we see three separate
representations of this motion.

107
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:05,370
y as a function of x, y
as a function of t, and x

108
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,223
as a function of t.
