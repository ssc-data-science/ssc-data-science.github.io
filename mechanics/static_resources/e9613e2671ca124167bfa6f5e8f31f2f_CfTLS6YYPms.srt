1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,980
Now let's go back and
analyze that same problem

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,010
that we were looking
at before of a wheel

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,290
rolling down an incline plane.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,760
And it's rolling
without slipping.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,220
But instead of using
the energy method,

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,340
we're now going to
use the torque method.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,670
So let's consider
the center of mass.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,800
And what we want to
do is draw the forces.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,930
We have a normal force.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,670
We have gravity.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,840
And we have the friction force
about the center of mass.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,870
Our wheel has a radius R.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,280
Let's choose a coordinate
system i hat, j hat.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,160
And so we have a
right-handed system k hat,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,270
and that will correspond
to some angle theta.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,160
Now here we're now going
to enlarge how we apply

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,920
both translation and rotation.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,750
And the beauty of
this problem is

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,030
we now can decompose our motion
into translational motion

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,630
and rotational motion.

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,660
So for the transitional
motion, we'll

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,240
apply Newton's second law.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,990
Now, if this is the
angle phi, then that's

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,789
the angle phi as well.

25
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,120
And so our forces in
the i hat direction, we

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,240
have mg sine phi minus
the friction force.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,180
And that's equal to the x
component of the acceleration.

28
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,050
Now we also can choose
the center of mass

29
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,320
to calculate the torque.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,300
And so what we're really
just studying here

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,890
is simply our old problem in the
center of mass frame of fixed

32
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,390
axis rotation.

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,450
And you can see gravity is
acting at the center of mass.

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,120
So it produces no torque
about the center of mass.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,470
The normal force is directed
towards the center of mass.

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:06,520
And so when we take that vector
product of R cross n from cm

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,710
to this point down
here, the contact point,

38
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,538
these forces are anti-parallel.

39
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,970
So the normal force
produces no torque.

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,960
And the only torque that we
have is from the friction force,

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,940
and that friction
torque is going

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,750
to give us a positive angular
acceleration in the k hat

43
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,640
direction.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,270
It's at right angles
with the vector R.

45
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:33,620
So we have fs times R equals
I center of mass times alpha.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,420
And these are our two
dynamic equations.

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,780
But remember, when the object
is rolling without slipping,

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,560
let's just remind ourselves
that Vcm equals R omega.

49
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
And if I differentiate, the Acm
which is what we're calling ax,

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,829
is equal to R alpha.

51
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,520
So this ax here is
the acceleration

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,079
of the center of mass.

53
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,330
And that's our third condition.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,820
And so now I see that
I have three equations

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,530
and my unknowns--

56
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,270
fs, ax and alpha.

57
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,290
And so I'm going to solve
these equations for a.

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,130
And I'll look at
these equations.

59
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,280
And what I'll do is I'll just
substitute for alpha ax over R.

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,750
And then solve this equation
for fs, and put it in there.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,500
And so I get mg sine phi.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:39,360
Now my fs is equal to
Icm over R times alpha.

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,470
But alpha is ax over R. So
that's ax and an R squared.

64
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,950
Notice dimensionally,
I is mr squared.

65
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,550
So this is just
ma, the dimensions

66
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,950
of force, mg dimensions of
force, and that's equal to max.

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,280
And now I can solve for ax.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:11,020
And I get mg sine phi divided
by m plus Icm over R squared.

69
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,790
Now ax is a constant.

70
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,390
And we can, from our
kinematic equations,

71
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:28,704
if our object is
moving a distance s

72
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:34,159
as it drops height h,
we know from kinematics

73
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,750
and we can work this out.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,930
We have that Xcm is
one half Acm t squared.

75
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:53,930
And we know that the velocity
Vcm equals Acm times t.

76
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,510
And so when we put
these two together,

77
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,110
this is the distance s,
we get that the velocity

78
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:12,600
cm is equal to the square
root of 2s times Acm.

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:21,990
Now s is equal to
h over sine phi.

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,140
S h over s is sine phi.

81
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:34,390
And so the Vcm equals the square
root of 2h sine phi times Acm--

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,040
but we've solved for Acm--

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:44,290
mg sine phi over m plus
Icm over R squared.

84
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:50,290
And so we get the
square root of 2mgh

85
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,650
over m plus Icm
divided by R squared.

86
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,900
And this agrees with
our energy method.
