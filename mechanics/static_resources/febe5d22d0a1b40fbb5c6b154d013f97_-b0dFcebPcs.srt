1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,960
The little prince is sitting
on his little planet,

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
and he's watching
the planets go by.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,690
And so suddenly, he's
seeing three of them.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,160
One, two, three.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,330
And he wonders, hmm, what
would the center of mass

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,180
of these three planets be?

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,060
So let's calculate it.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,890
We have one planet
here that's three times

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,030
the mass of this guy.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,390
And then this one
has half of m1.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,030
And I've written this
up there already.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,070
And the center of
mass, when we want

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,900
to determine its coordinate--
it is a coordinate

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,610
that depends on this
coordinate system,

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,430
and this origin
here-- then we need

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,430
to have the total
mass of the system,

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,160
because it's a
mass-weighted coordinate.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,680
And so the total mass
is going to be 4.5 m1.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,860
And if we want to
calculate this position

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,150
function of the
center of mass, Rcm,

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,720
that is the mass weight here.

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,810
And then we need the
sum of all of our masses

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,470
times our distances.

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,390
We're going to sum here
over j from 1 to n.

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,520
And what that means is
we need to now write out

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,690
the sum for our three planets.

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,800
And we need to give
this a radius here,

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,020
so the r1 would be
going from here to here.

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,020
r2 goes from here to there.

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,270
And r3 from here to here.

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,150
You need to write them
out in the i hat direction

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,335
and in the j hat direction.

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,160
Let's add that here.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,620
And then sum it all up
and calculate our r.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,040
So let's write this out.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,139
We have m1, and we're
going to have 35 and 10.

37
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:15,870
35 i hat plus 10 j hat plus m2.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,525
It's going to be 5 and 20.

39
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:24,390
5 and 20.

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,440
And then m3, we have 40 and 30.

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,780
And what we can do--
oh, and of course that

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,190
has to be divided
by my system mass.

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,579
And what we can do is
we can concentrate first

44
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:52,910
on the x component, and
then on the y component.

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,510
Maybe we'll just continue here.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,760
So we're going to have-- and
we can plug it in all the m's.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
We'll do it for the
x component first.

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:16,290
We're going to have m1, and
then we have 35 i hat plus here

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,720
we're going to have 1/2 m2.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:35,440
That is 3m1 5 plus-- and
for m3, we have 0.5 m1 40.

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,829
that's in the i hat direction.

52
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:44,510
And we'll have to divide
that over our system mass.

53
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,100
And then we do the same
for the y component.

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:04:10,600
So m1, 10 plus 3. m1,
20 plus 0.5 m1 30 j hat.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,839
And again, we have to divide
this over our system mass.

56
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,030
So this boils down to-- hang on.

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,100
Let me redo this again.

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,050
Let me actually look
at the answer first.

59
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,270
What do I have here?

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,310
70 and 85, OK.

61
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:42,150
So this boils to m1
over the system mass.

62
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:50,120
And we have 70 in the i hat
plus 85 in the j hat direction.

63
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,320
So the 70 comes from this
term, the 80 comes from this.

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,050
And I put it back together, and
now we need to plug in this one

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,500
here.

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:06,220
And so we will get in the end
of that Rcm equals m over 4.5 m.

67
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,970
So the m goes away, and we
have a factor of 1/4.5 here.

68
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,160
We'll divide this
through, and we're

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:30,580
going to have 15.5 in the
i hat direction, and 18.9

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,148
in the j hat direction.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,930
All right, so let's see where
this fits on our graph here.

72
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,740
So 15 in the i hat
is somewhere here.

73
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,380
And 19 is almost
20, so it's going

74
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,680
to be here, so about there.

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,830
So this is my Rcm,
and this here is

76
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:06,090
my center of mass of the system
of these three little planets.

77
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,750
Of course, we used approximate
math here for all the planets.

78
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,770
But if we look at
the real numbers,

79
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,740
imagine that this
would be Earth,

80
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,110
and it has one Earth mass.

81
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,350
And if this were Saturn,
it would have something

82
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,180
like 318 Earth masses.

83
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:34,600
And if this is Pluto, it would
have 0.0025 Earth masses.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,220
You will see that Saturn
really holds all the weight.

85
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,880
And if we were to do this
calculation with these numbers

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,100
here, then our Rcm would-- and
keeping this coordinate system

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,350
in the arrangement
of the planets,

88
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,810
then it would go right
into-- if here's the center,

89
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,920
it would go right next to
the center right over here,

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,720
because Saturn just weighs so,
so, so much more than Pluto

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,930
and Earth together.
