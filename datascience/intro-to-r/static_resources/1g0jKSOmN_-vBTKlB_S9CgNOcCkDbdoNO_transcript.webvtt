00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.670 align:middle line:84%
HELENA VALLICROSA: All right,
so we are back to the code.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
start applying the concepts

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking to
on R. So the first thing

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is to read vectorial maps.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:90%
How do we read vectorial maps?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Well here I included
a web page where you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:90%
can download vectorial maps.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
They are basically physical
vectors of the global Earth,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
so you can find the
coastal barriers.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The packages we're going
to use are these three.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I have already installed them.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But feel free to
install them, and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
lock them into the session.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
There are several ways
to read vectorial maps.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I just include
three of them here.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:90%
There's this one.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
My personal preference
is the second one.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
There's this third one that
I just put them in common.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So in the first one this, which
is using this function right

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
here, the projection needs
to be specified previously.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:90%
So here is what I am doing.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that I'm using
the projection longlat, which

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is longitude latitude, WGS84.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So I have to put
this between commas,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and using this
particular function here.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
be the projection.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm reading the
map, what I have to do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is to specify where this map
is located in your computer,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and then specify what
projection do you want it to be.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
So you'll have that map here.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It's giving me a warning,
just information.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:90%
But everything worked fine.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And my personal preference is
this one, where you don't even

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:90%
have to specify the projection.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be read
by the package itself.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
You only have to specify the
route from your computer.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:90%
You use this.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It gives you some information--

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
what it has read,
what it includes.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.643 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just going to plot,
just type plot, and the map

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
you want to plot,
and you're going

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:90%
to see how this map looks like.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
You see this is the
boundaries of the ground.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we move
on to raster maps.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty simple.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The king or the best
personal preference,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
but the best package to use
raster is the package raster.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can use it
to manage everything

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:90%
you need from rasters.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to load
it into the session.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's as easy
just to put raster

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
here and the route of your map.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to chart a
temperature map that I've

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:90%
taken from WorldClairm.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.362 align:middle line:84%
And it's in 10
minutes resolution.

00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:14.185 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
see how it looks like.

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is how by default
the map is created.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you feel like
magnifying your map,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:90%
you can just click on zoom here.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to pop
out in an outside window.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So you will be able
to see it bigger.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
a particular way

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of displaying maps
which is using

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
NC format, which is when you
are working on time series maps.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Just because the maps
are pretty heavy data,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
this is a particular
way to store time series

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:90%
in a pretty efficient way.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But that makes it a little
tricky to work with.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
show you how to do that.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to clean
my environment

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to not being distracting.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.198 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
These are the packages
you're going to need

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:90%
to go through this code.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It's going to load them all.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a map
that I have obtained

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:90%
based on this reference here.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
If you click on
that link, you would

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:84%
be able to download this
information from the internet.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a nitrogen deposition
map that goes from,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
if I remember correctly,
from 1901 to 2020

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So every time to
time there is a map.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
a time series.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have to picture,
let's say a book.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And each page of
the book is a map.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:90%
So you have them all together.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And they are all the same
size, the same resolution.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But you have a repetition
in time of the same map.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all,
is to open the file.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%
So nc_open where the map is.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:90%
You take the map.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And if that would
be a raster, you

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
plot it right away.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I try here.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
No worries.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work,
but it's just to show you

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that it's a different
way of organizing maps.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So how do we do
it, to extract it

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and to convert it into a map
we can see, we can visualize,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:90%
we can understand?

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we
need to do is to see

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
what are the names of
the dimension of the map.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Just click names, the
map, and dimensions.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
return the three dimensions

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that we need to know which is
the longitude, the latitude,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:90%
and the time.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, the author's
name, this variable

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:90%
is differently.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So here is longlat, but it
could be longitude latitude,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
or time could be years,
or things like that.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need to
make sure how this is named.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
extract the longitude.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Here is where we get
the map structure.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:90%
We have longitude.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We variable get the longitude.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, and we store it in a vector.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And here we want to
extract the latitude.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
We repeat the same, but
with latitude instead.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And here we are extracting the
information related to the time.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And now we see that the latitude
is cut in 360 different columns

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or rows, and the longitude
likewise, but 720.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to get
the actual information.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
content of the cells?

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
So we do this like that.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So here is the content.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Something else we need to take
into account is the NA values.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So when creating a
map, there is a value

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:90%
that you use to name your NA.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's NA right away.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But some other people use
numbers like 9,999, or just

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:90%
a big number.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And here what we are doing is
to explore how the authors have

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:90%
named this NA value.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:90%
So this one I want to see.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the big number they
named as missing value.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So to avoid this number
to mess with our results,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you to
change it to NA.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm doing here.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.433 align:middle line:84%
I'm replacing every number
that looks like this, to an NA.

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry that
you are not going

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to knock out important data.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just mostly
going to be NAs.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:90%
We run this chunk of code.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, it should go.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.442 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:46.525 align:middle line:84%
It's taking a while because
there's a lot of data.

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, here we have it.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So now all the NAs would
be replaced into NA value.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And now we no longer need
to have opened them up.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.051 align:middle line:84%
So we can close it and
it doesn't occupy space

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:90%
in our session.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Just close it because we already
have the information we need.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And how are we going to
transform this information we

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
have in different chunks
into an organized map

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
visualize and work with?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, here I'm
going to run an example.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to use the
package raster right here.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
I need to include this t
here, which means transpose,

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise if
I don't put transpose,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:90%
the image would look flipped.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Then this is the object.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
These are the different
dimensions-- longitude,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
latitude, and this
number 1 is going

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:90%
to be the first time frame.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just get
the first map that we have.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Then it asks us for the
minimum of the x-axis.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put the
minimum of the longitude,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
the maximum of the longitude,
and just basically setting up

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:90%
the format of this raster map.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to specify as
well the projection.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
be the projection

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that it's the same that we've
used before in other maps.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.965 align:middle line:84%
And we just run
this chunk of code.

00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And we can plot our results.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:90%
This is how the map looks like.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the nitrogen deposition
in, I believe in 1901.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And it includes also the sea.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it doesn't
look like the Earth

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
that we're used to.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And then how can we store this
information in our computer?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
How can we write this raster?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's just as easy
as write raster, put

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
the name of the file we
want to store, file name,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and your route as follows.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So now we are moving
to the resolution.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And you might have
paid attention

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
when downloading the
data from the WorldClaim

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that it allows you
to download the maps

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
in different resolutions.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But in order to name the
different resolutions,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:90%
WorldClaim, it uses time.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:90%
So why is that?

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, you could
face three different ways

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:90%
to approach resolution.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The first of all is the surface
using the surface square.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
One example would is
1 kilometer square.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
That refers to the map when we
have it in a representation.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:84%
In a gridded
representation, we would

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
have each side of the grid
calculated by the surface

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%
that it's occupying.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So just take this
that's 1 kilometer.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's 1 kilometer.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
The problem of this approach is
that it's not always accurate.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the part of the
grid that's closer to

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the equator is smaller than the
one that it goes to the pole.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So it stretches when
it goes to the edges.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that makes that
this 1 kilometer is not

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
consistent throughout
the whole map.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And to overcome this
problem, it came

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
with the angle or the time
approach, which treats

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
the Earth as a round surface.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not perfect because,
the round is not 100% perfect,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's better than
using the surface.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is to
consider on one side

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
the angle that this opening is.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So just let's take
this square right here.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And let's just plot
it on top of this.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So that the angle
that covers this part

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
of the surface, that would
be displayed in the angle,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
or also the time that the
Earth needs to rotate and cover

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:90%
this amount of surface.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So for you to have a
reference, for example,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
1 kilometer square resolution
would be the same as 30 seconds

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
So going back to the code.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Here I downloaded two
different resolutions

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
for the temperature
maps on WorldClaim.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%
One is 10 minutes.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And the other one is 30 seconds.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The 10 minutes is
OK to download.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The 30 seconds, it
might take a while.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
If your internet
connection is slow,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
you can just believe
what I'm saying.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to try it
out, obviously feel free.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Just to remind you how
the map looks like,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:90%
it's going to look like this.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's just check the
resolution here on both maps.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Here we have this number here.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:90%
But what does it mean?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Here we have this
other number here.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we consult the
resolution in our maps,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be shown in
degrees, so using the angle

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
approach that I
previously mentioned.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So how can we change
resolution in a map?

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:90%
We can use the factor aggregate.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a number
that's bigger than 1,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:90%
we are going to combine cells.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we have in this case,
I'm combining in a factor of 4,

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning that four cells
horizontal and four cells

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
vertical are going to
be combined in one.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways to
calculate the resultant cell.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So it could be using the mode,
or it could be using the mean,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
depending on what kind of
data you have in your map.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But you could also
increase your resolution

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
by using a number
that's lower than 1.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's if you
put, let's say 0.5,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
divide a cell in 4.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we're working
in two dimensions.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is
technically correct,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
but conceptually it doesn't
really make a lot of sense.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.913 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
creating fake data.

00:14:19.913 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you are
actually including

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the resolution of how good
you are approaching reality.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
You are just creating more
data for no more accuracy.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, I'm
going to aggregate the map

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:90%
that we have in a factor of 4.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to consult
how the resolution has changed.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So initially I
aggregated this one.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%
This was the initial resolution.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And once the
resolution was changed,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I see the degrees
has gone bigger

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:90%
because the surface is bigger.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So the time or the degree to
cover that surface is bigger.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you plot
that, you might be

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
able to see that the quality
of the image is a little worse.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:90%
