HELENA VAILLICROSA: In
this section of the course,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go directly jump to
GIS, so geographic information

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And before going
directly to the code,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to make
sure that everybody

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
is in the same page
in some key concepts.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm just going
to clarify some of them.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So what you are going to
learn in this video is to be

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
familiarized with concepts
such as what are vectorial maps

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and what are raster maps-- so
what are the differences among

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
them and where should we
use one or the other--

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
what is the projection--
so why do we

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
need different
projections-- also

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
what's the concept of
resolution and why should we

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
take into account resolution
when working with maps, and also

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:90%
different ways to create maps.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are mostly two
different approaches

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to create maps with.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
The first one would
be the satellite maps

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:90%
that are created top to bottom.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
maps that are upscaled

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:90%
that are the other way around.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So they are created
bottom to top.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So my goal is that
then you would

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
be able to apply
all these concepts

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and manage all these
concepts in your R code.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
same image represented

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:90%
in the two different maps.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is represented
using a vectorial map.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is
represented using raster.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The main difference is
that, in vectorial maps,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:90%
we can have irregular polygons.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the raster
maps, we have a grid,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
where all the cells are
equally distributed.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:90%
They have the same size.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are in the
same disposition.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So that might affect how the
different forms are represented.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So in case we are interested
in the shape of the objects,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe we would go
to a vectorial map.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But if we are interested
in the content of the map,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
we would go to raster
representations.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Also, there is the
concept of projection.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
As we all know, the Earth
is not a flat surface.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So to overcome this
representation in--

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to convert this round shape
into something that's flat,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
we have encountered
several problems.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have different
projections depending on where

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
we want to focus better on.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So each representation
has its pros and cons.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we are
more interested in having

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
accurate shapes in the poles,
we would use one projection.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to see
accurately the whole globe,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe we choose something else.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But that has implications
in how the shapes look like.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
is the same face,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
but how this can be transformed
or deformed depending

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:90%
on how we are representing it.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is something we have to
take into account because if we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
want to merge or extract
information from different maps,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
they may be in
different projections.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And how is this affecting us?

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, here you see South America
and how this South America can

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
be represented and how its
shape can change depending

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:90%
on the projection we are using.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So before moving on in
maps, we have to make sure

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that the projection,
we are using

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is accurate to the piece of the
Earth that we want to represent

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.193 align:middle line:84%
or that we want
to work on, what's

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
the scale we are
going to work on,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.318 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to work
in a regional part

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
or if we're going to
work in a global scale,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and also make sure that
all the column maps are

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
in the same
projection so we don't

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.675 align:middle line:90%
have problems as in the image.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
resolution concept.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a picture.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But a picture would be a
good proxy of a raster map.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
At the end, they
are built the same.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:90%
So here, we have the same image.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And the main difference
is that the square size

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So the first one, the
one is more in the left,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have that
much of a detail.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is very detailed.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
One would think that
it's always better

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to go to more
detailed resolution.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But this has some
drawbacks, which is

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that they are way more heavy.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the
capacity your computer has

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
or depending on how good is
your internet connection,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you might go to
one or the other.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Just as a reminder,
sometimes even

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
if you are increasing
the resolution,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's not
going to help us

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to have more accurate
calculations just

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because the quality of the map
was initially not the purest

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and was created in a
coarser resolution.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
So even if we go to--

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.460 align:middle line:84%
if we can transform a coarser
resolution to a more fine scale,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
we are not creating
new information.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the top-bottom
approach of creating maps.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We know that we have satellites
going around above our heads.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So they use as a big
camera, let's say.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
So they have different sensors.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They have different lenses.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So they are taking
pictures or representations

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
of the surface of the Earth.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So they send
different wavelengths.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
some bounced back.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they read
the signal of that.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And based on those signals,
they apply some corrections

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
create satellite images.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But then another way to
create maps sometimes,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have a
signal from a satellite,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:90%
would be the upscaling approach.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Here in the first map,
we have different dots.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
This is taken from a
paper, Du et al 2020.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just an example
of an upscaled map

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
where they had real data.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So each point is representing
a real point, where

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:90%
some field data has been taken.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Then based on this
real information,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
a model is created using
some environmental drivers,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:90%
solid drivers.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And a model is created.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And with this model, then
we can empty the spaces

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that are in between the
different points based

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
on upscaling using that map.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we can obtain
maps from a bottom-top approach.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And also, here
are some resources

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
you can find raster maps.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the World Clim, ,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
where you can find environmental
variables such as, well,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:90%
related to climate--

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
precipitation,
temperature, and so forth.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then if you are interested
in obtaining information

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
from soils, you might
go to Soil Grids, where

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot of physical
and chemical properties

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:90%
of different soils.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:90%
