Elements of probability theory, sampling theory, statistical estimation, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing. It uses elementary econometrics and other applications of statistical tools to economic data. It also provides a solid foundation in probability and statistics for economists and other social scientists. We will emphasize topics needed in the further study of econometrics and provide basic preparation for [_14.32 Econometrics_](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-32-econometrics-spring-2007/index.htm). No prior preparation in probability and statistics is required, but familiarity with basic algebra and calculus is assumed.",
