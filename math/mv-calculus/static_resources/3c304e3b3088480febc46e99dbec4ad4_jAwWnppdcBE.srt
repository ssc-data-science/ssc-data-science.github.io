1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,162
Welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:10,850
In this video I'd
like us to work

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,660
on the following application
for spherical coordinates.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,060
So what I'd like
us to do is find

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,850
the gravitational attraction
of an upper solid half

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,700
sphere of radius a
and center O, that's

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,670
the gravitational attraction
on a mass m naught at O.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,880
So the m naught is sitting at
O, we have a solid half sphere

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,125
of radius a and
center O, and we want

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,620
to find the gravitational
attraction of the half sphere

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,180
on the mass.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,940
And we're going to
assume that the density

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,990
delta is equal to
the square root of x

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,280
squared plus y squared.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,015
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while

16
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,430
to work on it, and when you
feel good about your solution,

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,513
bring the video back up,
I'll show you what I did.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,300
OK.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,089
Welcome back.

20
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,880
Again what we're going
to do is we're going

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,640
to do an application problem.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,480
And what we have is we
have the solid half sphere

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,250
of radius a and
center O, and we want

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,660
to know the gravitational
attraction of it

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,394
on a mass m naught.

26
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:09,810
So the first thing
I'm going to do

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,240
is draw a picture, just so
I can get myself oriented.

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,930
The easiest thing
to do-- obviously,

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,680
when I'm going to try
and figure this out,

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm going to use
spherical coordinates.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,050
I have an upper
solid half sphere,

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,651
so that should tell me spherical
coordinates will be good.

33
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,900
And the easiest way to deal
with spherical coordinates

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,470
is obviously to choose
O to be the origin.

35
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,754
So I'm going to have m naught
sitting right at the origin.

36
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,170
And then I'm going
to have-- oops,

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,628
I should write that
somewhere else.

38
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,538
Maybe, well, I'll
just leave it there--

39
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,246
and then I'm going to
have the solid half

40
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:46,485
sphere, which I'm going to
just draw sort of like this.

41
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,360
Maybe that doesn't look
like a sphere to you.

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,910
But we have the
solid half sphere

43
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,880
and it's exerting a
force on m naught.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,030
And if I want to
know the force-- how

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,820
we denote the force in
lecture was the components

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,510
were the x-component
of the force,

47
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,360
the y-component of the
force, and the z-component

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,279
of the force.

49
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,820
And so I want to point out these
are not partial derivatives.

50
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,655
This is the standard notation
you use for force in this case,

51
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,530
and so these are not
the partial derivatives.

52
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,446
They're just the
x-component, the y-component,

53
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:15,530
and the z-component.

54
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,830
And if you notice,
this upper solid half

55
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,440
sphere-- because of
where m naught is,

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,610
the x-component and the
y-component of the force

57
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,530
are 0 based on symmetry.

58
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,310
So all I really need to worry
about is the z-component.

59
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,670
I'm only really interested
in one component of the force

60
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,950
and it's the z-component.

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,130
Because the other two
are going to be 0, just

62
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,257
by the symmetry of
this solid half sphere.

63
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,840
So I really only
need the z-component.

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,850
So what I have to do, in
order to calculate the force,

65
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,895
is I have to figure out the
magnitude and the direction.

66
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,520
So let's write down
the two components.

67
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,310
These were given
to you in class.

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:59,120
So the magnitude is going
to be equal to G m naught

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,120
dm divided by rho squared.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,850
So this was given to
you in class already.

71
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,770
So G is some constant; m
naught is the mass you have;

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,116
dm, we have to determine
a little bit about it;

73
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,740
and then we're dividing
by rho squared.

74
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,410
And the direction--
because I'm only

75
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,720
interested in the z-component--
the direction is just z,

76
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,340
but then I want to make sure
that the direction component is

77
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,460
z divided by rho.

78
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,272
The full direction is
[x, y, z] divided by rho,

79
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,230
but I'm only interested
in that last component.

80
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,961
So the z-component
is just z over rho.

81
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:34,336
If that confused
you, I just want

82
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:38,430
to remind you that
you had [x,  y, z]

83
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,010
over rho is the full
direction of the force,

84
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,130
we're just pulling
off the z-component.

85
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,340
So what we're going to
be trying to figure out--

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,820
we need to integrate the
product of these two things,

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,706
but I need to figure
out what dm actually is.

88
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,830
So let me remind you also
what dm is and then we'll

89
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,180
put it all together.

90
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,140
dm, to remind you, is supposed
to be the density times dV.

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,120
And the density in this
case was square root

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,150
of x squared plus y squared,
that's just equal to r.

93
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,360
So it's just r*dV.

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,820
So there's a bunch
of little pieces

95
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,430
and now I have to
put them together.

96
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,790
So if I want to determine
the full attraction

97
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,590
in the z-direction, because
the other two are 0,

98
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,090
I just need to do
this triple integral.

99
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,780
I'll figure out my
bounds momentarily.

100
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,363
I'm going to leave a lot of room
to write my bounds, because I

101
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:29,770
always run out of room.

102
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,870
And then I just
need to integrate

103
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,810
G m naught divided by rho
squared times z divided

104
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,145
by rho times r dV.

105
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,770
Actually I won't even
do the bounds yet

106
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,170
because I have to
change everything

107
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,030
into polar coordinates.

108
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,460
So let's figure
out how to do that.

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,090
What is z in polar
coordinates? z

110
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,510
in polar coordinates we
know is rho cosine phi.

111
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,420
So I'm going to
have a G m naught--

112
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm going to keep this
rho cubed right here--

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,190
and then I'm going to
have a rho cosine phi.

114
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,090
r is rho sine phi, so I'll
just put another rho, and then

115
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,520
a sine phi.

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:20,320
And then dV is rho squared
sine phi d rho d phi d theta.

117
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,870
So what I'm going
to do here is--

118
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,220
I have to add in a rho squared,
so I'm just going to cube this.

119
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,240
And another sine phi, so
I'm going to square that.

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,940
And then I'm going to have
a d rho d phi d theta.

121
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,920
Hopefully that wasn't too scary.

122
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
But the z is my rho cosine phi.

123
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,540
The r is a single rho sine phi.

124
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,250
And then dV includes a
rho squared sine phi,

125
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,580
so I put a cubed here
and a squared here,

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,789
and then d rho d phi d theta.

127
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,330
So now I just have
to integrate, so I

128
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,000
have to figure out my bounds.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,170
So we're integrating
first in rho.

130
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,740
And rho, it's a sphere- a
half sphere of radius a.

131
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,830
It's a solid half sphere.

132
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,980
So I'm just integrating
from 0 up to a.

133
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,420
And then phi-- because
it's a solid half sphere,

134
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,410
phi is starting at 0
and it's going down

135
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,140
until it hits the xy-plane.

136
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,240
And so that's pi over 2.

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,580
We know we start at 0, we go to
pi over 2 when we go a quarter

138
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,300
turn, basically.

139
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,300
When we go 90 degrees, right?

140
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,530
So we go 0 to pi over
2, and then theta--

141
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,270
once I've taken my rho and
I've gone up as far as I can,

142
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,770
and I've gone down this way, I
have to rotate it all the way

143
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,210
around-- and so theta is
actually going from 0 to 2*pi.

144
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,010
All right.

145
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,600
So this is my full
integral I have here.

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,130
And now let's do
some simplifying

147
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,400
before we integrate.

148
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,790
Notice I have a rho cubed
in the denominator here

149
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,590
and a rho cubed in
the numerator there.

150
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,450
So when I integrate in rho,
I only have this single rho.

151
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,150
When I integrate that rho,
everything else is fixed.

152
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,110
So I integrate that rho, I
get a rho squared over 2,

153
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,340
and I evaluate it
at 0 and a and so I

154
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,946
get an a squared over 2,
as integrating this part.

155
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,570
I'm going to pull
all that to the front

156
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,652
and then write what I get next.

157
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:06,860
Let me write what I get next.

158
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm going to have a G
m naught as a constant.

159
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,550
I'm going to be multiplying
by a squared over 2

160
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,020
from the rho integral.

161
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,640
And then I have
2 more integrals.

162
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,850
Integral from 0 to 2*pi.

163
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:24,330
And the integral from 0 to
pi over 2 of cosine phi sine

164
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,900
squared phi d phi d theta.

165
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,940
So how do I integrate
this in phi?

166
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,820
Looks like it's going to
be sine cubed phi over 3.

167
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,890
Let me just double check.

168
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,450
The derivative of that is 3
sine squared phi cosine phi.

169
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,950
Yes.

170
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,660
So, this is going to be
sine cubed phi over 3

171
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,000
evaluated at 0 and pi over 2.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,972
This inner part is.

173
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:49,430
And so let's see
what we get there.

174
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
Sine of 0 is 0.

175
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,850
Sine of pi over 2 is 1.

176
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,169
So I just pick up a
1/3 from this integral.

177
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,960
So now I'm going to
pull that out in front.

178
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,220
So again, the thing
I've written down here

179
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,950
is just the integral of this.

180
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,997
So I just get a 1/3 out of that.

181
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:08,830
Let me double check.

182
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,521
Yep, sine of pi
over 2 is still 1.

183
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,020
Good.

184
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,490
So I get a 1/3 out of that.

185
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,240
That's a constant.

186
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,670
So I'll pull that to the front.

187
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,128
And then notice
what I'm left with.

188
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,070
I'm just integrating
0 to 2*pi of d theta.

189
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,850
Well that's just 2*pi.

190
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,915
So I've got a 1/3
from the inside one,

191
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,310
times a 2*pi from
the outside one.

192
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,750
So I just end up getting
2*pi times-- or 2*pi over 3,

193
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,070
because there's my 1/3 also--
times G m naught a squared over

194
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,000
2.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,300
And if I simplify
that, I just get

196
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,290
G m naught a squared pi over 3.

197
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,270
And so if I want to know
the force of this solid half

198
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,160
sphere acting on the mass
m naught, where the mass is

199
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,550
positioned at the center of the
base of the solid half sphere,

200
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,540
it's going to be exactly
the following thing.

201
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,920
By symmetry, the first
two components are 0

202
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,440
and the last component is this
G m naught a squared pi over 3.

203
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,290
And so that's my final solution.

204
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,790
Let me just take us back and
remind us where we came from.

205
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,590
So we wanted to find the force,
the gravitational attraction

206
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,600
of this solid half sphere that
had a radius a, was centered

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,070
at O, and had mass m
naught sitting at O.

208
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,070
And so we were interested
in drawing the easiest

209
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,800
picture possible.

210
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,258
We're going to put
O at the origin,

211
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:34,620
so m naught's at the origin.

212
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,190
Then we have a solid
half sphere of radius a.

213
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,231
So this is-- you know, if
I come all the way out,

214
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,280
my radius length is a.

215
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,770
And I gave you the
density was equal to r.

216
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,220
So we know-- the force
we're interested in,

217
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,620
F sub x, F sub y, F sub
z, from the picture alone,

218
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,860
we see F sub x
and F sub y are 0.

219
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,670
So we really only
need the z-component.

220
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,570
So you know how to
find the magnitude

221
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,626
and you know how to find the
direction of the vector field.

222
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,625
The reason that you've
divided by rho here, just

223
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,166
to remind you, is
that the direction,

224
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,790
you want it to be a unit vector.

225
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,680
And so this is what
makes it a unit vector.

226
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,160
And so the direction part
that I'm interested in

227
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,470
is the z-part.

228
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,380
So it's z over rho.

229
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,420
And so all I need to do
is take the z over rho,

230
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,230
multiply it by the magnitude,
and replace the dm by what it

231
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,910
is in terms of the volume form.

232
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,910
And in terms of the volume
form, it's the density times dV

233
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,240
and so in this case
it's just r*dV.

234
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,490
So I made all those
substitutions.

235
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,701
And then all I had to do
is do a lot of replacement.

236
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,200
And that was kind
of the messy part,

237
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,050
and then the
integral's fairly easy.

238
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,690
So the messy part is z I
replaced by rho cosine phi.

239
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,810
r I replaced by rho sine phi.

240
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,264
And dV I replaced by rho squared
sine phi d rho d phi d theta.

241
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:46,680
And then I just
have to figure out

242
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,265
what the bounds are for the
half sphere, solid half sphere.

243
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,140
And then I integrate.

244
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,690
And the integration
is all ultimately

245
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,110
one step at a time,
single variable.

246
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,870
And they were all
fairly simple integrals.

247
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,790
So in the end, we see that
your mass m naught sitting

248
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,490
at the origin, the force exerted
on it by this solid half sphere

249
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,960
is 0, 0 comma G times m naught
times a squared pi divided

250
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,870
by 3.

251
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,150
All right, that's
where I'll stop.
