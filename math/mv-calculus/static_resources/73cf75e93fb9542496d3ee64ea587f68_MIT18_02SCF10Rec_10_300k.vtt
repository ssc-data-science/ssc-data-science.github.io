00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.440
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.950
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.260
In lecture, you've begun
learning about various

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.070
different ways to describe
planes in

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.380
three dimensional space.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.560
In particular, there are
equations and ways you can

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.830
translate between other
characterizations.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.490
So I have here four different
planes for you described in

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.920
four different ways, and what
I'd like you to do is try and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.950
figure out what the equations
for each of

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.210
these four planes are.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730
So let me see what they are.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.120
So we've got the first
one-- part a--

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.510
we have a plane where I'm giving
you its normal vector

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.270
N, which is the vector
1, 2, 3.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.740
And I'm going to tell you that
the plane is passing through

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.570
the point 1, 0, minus 1.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.030
In part b, I'm telling you that
the plane passes through

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
the origin, and also that it's
parallel to two vectors.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.900
It's parallel to the vector 1,
0, minus 1, and to the vector

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.510
minus 1, 2, 0.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.760
In part c, I'm telling you that
a plane passes through

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.790
the points 1, 2, 0--

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.910
3, 1, 1--

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.370
and 2, 0, 0.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.640
And in part d, I'm telling you
that the plane is parallel to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.830
the plane in part a, and also
that it passes through the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.770
point 1, 2, 3.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.430
So what I'd like you to do is
try for each of these four

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.750
descriptions, figure out what
the equation of the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.600
associated plane is.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.980
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.500
work those all out, come
back, and we can

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.750
work them out together.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.830
So hopefully you had some luck
working on these problems.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.850
Let's get started.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
So we may as well start
with the first one.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.890
So in part a, we're given that
the normal vector N is the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.330
vector i plus 2j plus 3k, or
1, 2, 3 and that it passes

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.640
through the point P--

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850
which I'm going to call P--

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.370
1, 0, minus 1.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.180
So this is a form you
learned in lecture.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.450
And so it's pretty
straightforward to write down

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.530
the equation here.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.400
The thing to remember is that
if a point x, y, z is on the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.890
plane, then we have to have
that the vector N--

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.840
the normal--

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.420
is orthogonal to the vector
connecting the point x, y, z

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.370
to the point we know.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.310
So that's the vector x
minus 1, y minus 0--

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.590
which is just y--

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.950
z plus 1.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.190
So N and this vector that lies
in the plane have to be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.010
orthogonal, so their dot
product has to be 0.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.640
And now you just multiply
this out.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.730
So in our case, so N is 1, 2,
3, and you take the dot

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.830
product with x minus 1, y, z,
and you get 1 times x minus 1,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.710
plus 2 times y, plus 3 times
z plus 1, equals 0.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.670
So that's the equation
of the plane.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.640
You could also rewrite this
a bunch of different ways.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.050
For example, you could multiply
through and collect

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.340
all the constants together.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.610
So you could write this
as x plus 2y plus 3z--

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.350
and then we've got a minus 1
plus 3, so that's plus 2--

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.640
equals 0.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.980
So these are two different
possible

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.890
forms for that equation.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.930
And you can, you know, sometimes
people write the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.090
constant over on this
side instead of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.993
leaving 0 over there.

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:17.450
All right.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.640
So several different, equivalent
ways to rewrite it.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.430
All right.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.560
So there's the equation
for part a.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.720
Now let's take a
look at part b.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.170
So for part b we have--

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.130
let's go just back and
remind ourselves what

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.200
the question was--

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.000
so we have a plane that passes
through the origin.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.310
So we know a point on the plane,
and we know that it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.770
parallel to the two vectors 1,
0, minus 1, and minus 1, 2, 0.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.110
OK.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.940
So we've got a point and we have
two direction vectors.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.680
And so that definitely describes
a plane for us, as

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.500
long as the two directions
aren't parallel, which they

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.800
aren't in this case.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.090
So the question is how do we
figure out what the equation

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.380
for that plane is?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.930
Well, we have this nice way of
figuring out equations for

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.800
planes when we know a
point and a normal.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.340
And we know a point, so what
would be great is if we could

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.350
come up with a normal direction
to this plane.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.680
So OK.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.980
So we have two vectors in the
plane, and we want to find a

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.330
vector that's perpendicular
to the plane.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.320
Well, we have a nice tool when
you're given two vectors to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.310
figure out a vector
perpendicular to both of them,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.020
and that's to take the
cross product.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.590
So our normal vector should be
the cross product of these two

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.670
vectors, or, you know,
any multiple of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.190
it would do as well.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.250
So for part b, the normal N
should be the cross product of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.460
the two vectors that are in the
plane, so it should be the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.870
cross product of 1,
0, minus 1, and--

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.370
what's the other one--
minus 1, 2, 0.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.110
So, all right, so we just have
to compute what that cross

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.360
product is.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:08.390
So this is a determinant whose
first row is i, j, k, and

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.850
whose second and third
rows are the two

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.160
vectors we're crossing.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.990
And OK, so we can
expand this out.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.640
So, if you like,
so this is i--

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.100
the coordinate of i is going
to be 0 minus minus

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.795
2, so that's 2.

00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:25.600
The coordinate of j is going
to be the negative of the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.650
determinant of this minor,
which is 0 minus minus

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.015
1 times minus 1.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:34.835
So the determinant of the
minor is minus 1, so the

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.630
coordinate of j is going
to be plus 1.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.350
And the coordinate of k is the
determinant of this minor,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.060
which is just 2.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.380
So the normal vector in this
case is the vector 2, 1, 2.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.130
So OK.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.660
So now we've got a normal vector
and we have a point.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.880
We were given that the plane
passes through the origin.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.070
So the equation, using
the same idea as in

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.885
the previous question.

00:06:01.885 --> 00:06:04.050
So the origin is just 0, 0, 0.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.850
That's a nice point to know
it passes through.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:14.420
So the equation is just 2x plus
y plus 2z is equal to 0.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.590
So this is the equation
in part b.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.940
All right.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.090
So part c, we're given
that the plane passes

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.950
through three points.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.650
So once again, three points.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.240
So we have a point
in particular.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.520
We have three of them.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.430
And so what we need then
to get to the equation

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.560
is we need a normal.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.460
And we saw in part b that we
could get a normal if we knew

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.120
two vectors that lay
in the plane.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.250
So in this case, we
have three points.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.970
So what we'd like is to find
two vectors that lie in the

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.950
plane, and then use those two
vectors to come up with a

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.540
normal to the plane.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.202
So in our case that's
particularly--

00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:56.130
well, in any case--

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.970
that's not that hard.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.650
You have three points, right?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.180
So you have three points
somewhere, P, Q, and R. And so

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.100
if you want to know two vectors
in the same plane as

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.310
these three points, well, you
could just take the vectors

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.200
that connect one of the points
to two of others, for example.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.830
So in our case, the plane--

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:30.700
since the plane passes through
the points 1, 2, 0, and 3, 1,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.450
1, and what's the last
one, 2, 0, 0.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.390
So the plane is parallel to--
well, it doesn't matter which

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.460
one we choose, so for example,
we can say the vector that

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.960
goes from here to here, so we
take this and subtract that

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.780
from it, so that would give
us, for example--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.890
2, minus 1, 1.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.580
And we could say the vector from
here to here, so we take

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.890
this and subtract
that from it.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:12.270
And that will give
us 1, minus 2, 0.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.390
So from three points we could
get two vectors that are

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.580
parallel to the plane.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.070
And we have a choice
of a point to use.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.150
We could use, for example,
the same point 1, 2,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.810
0 as our base point.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.630
And so then we can go back
and do exactly what

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.830
we did in part b.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.650
So with those two vectors, you
can take their cross product,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.300
and find a normal vector
to the plane.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.790
So I'm not going to
do that for you.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.650
I'll leave that for you
as an exercise.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:42.420
Finally, in part d, we have a
plane that's parallel to the

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.950
plane in part a, and passes
through 1, 2, 3.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.080
The point 1, 2, 3.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.490
So let me just rewrite over
here, parallel to-- so the

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.730
plane in part a had equation--

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:09.700
x plus 2y plus 3z plus 2 equals
0, and passing through

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.400
the point 1, 2, 3.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.030
All right.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.600
So this is the information that
we know about our plane

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.100
in this case.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.060
We know that it's parallel to
the plane with this equation,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.840
and that it passes through
the point 1, 2, 3.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.410
Well, it's parallel
to this plane.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.580
Two planes are parallel exactly
when they have the

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.390
same normal vector.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.300
So remember that the normal
vector here is always going to

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.070
be encoded by these coefficients
of x, y, z.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.290
In part a, this plane had normal
vector 1, 2, 3, and

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.370
that 1, 2, 3 shows up in the
coefficient of x, coefficient

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.230
of y, and coefficient of z,
which are 1, 2, and 3,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.400
respectively.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.820
So to get parallel planes when
you have the equation already,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.630
one thing you could do is you
can just say, oh, so that just

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.030
means I leave these coefficients
the same, and I

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.950
have to change the constant.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.420
Another thing you could do is
you could just go back to our

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.420
definition and say, OK, so
we know that the normal

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.360
vector is 1, 2, 3--

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.880
the vector 1, 2, 3--

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.730
and that it passes through
the point 1, 2, 3.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.730
Either of these two
methods will work.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.996
So let me describe, let me show
you what this second,

00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:18.960
this new method I
mentioned is.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.650
So we know that the equation of
the plane has to be x plus

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:29.970
2y plus 3z plus something--

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:35.050
that's a big question
mark there--

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.710
equal to 0.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.210
We know that the equation of the
plane is going to have to

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.350
look like this.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.550
Because it has the same normal
vector, it has to be parallel

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.300
to this plane.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.000
And so then we just need to
figure out what goes into this

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.340
box in order to make this the
equation of the right plane.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.680
Well, what else do we know?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.490
We know that it passes through
the point 1, 2, 3.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.880
So when we put in 1 for x, 2
for y, and 3 for z, this

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.190
equation has to be true.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.620
This point 1, 2, 3 has to be a
solution to this equation.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.370
So when we put in 1, 2, and 3,
we have to have that 1, plus 2

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:15.640
times 2, plus 3 times 3, plus
that same question mark, is

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.280
equal to 0.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.120
Well, this part is 1 plus 4
plus 9 is 14, so 14 plus

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.830
whatever goes in here has to be
equal to 0, so this better

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.383
be equal to negative 14.

00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:30.180
Negative 14.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.620
So the equation for the plane in
that case is exactly x plus

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.210
2y plus 3z minus 14 equals 0.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.180
Now, if you didn't like that
method, the other thing you

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.920
can do-- which I said before,
let me just repeat it-- is

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.860
that since it's parallel to this
plane, it has the same

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.890
normal vector.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.240
And we knew that the normal
vector to this

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.740
plane was 1, 2, 3.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.760
So you have a normal vector--
the vector 1, 2, 3-- and you

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.550
have a point--

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.700
the point 1, 2, 3-- and so you
can just use the usual process

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.570
given a point and
a normal vector.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.990
So just to recap, we
had four different

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.380
characterizations of a plane.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.110
We had a plane given in terms
of its normal vector and a

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.470
point that it contains.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.330
We had a plane given in terms
of a point and two vectors

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.300
parallel to it.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.270
We had a plane given in terms
of three points on it.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.850
And we had a plane given in
terms of a point and of

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.570
another plane parallel to it.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.970
So we have in all these
different cases, we can apply

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.150
different methods to compute
the equation of our plane.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.530
So in the first case, we just
do this very straightforward

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.010
computation that you saw
on lecture here.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.040
Where you just realize that the
normal vector has to be

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.330
orthogonal to the vector
lying in the plane.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.110
So you take their dot product
and that gives you the

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.710
equation right away.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:49.433
In the second case, where you
had two parallel vectors--or

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:49.710
sorry, yeah--

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.270
two parallel vectors to the
plane-- two vectors lying in

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:51.900
the plane--

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.430
you need to come up
with a normal.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.370
And you can always come up
with a normal by taking a

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.260
cross product of those
two vectors, as

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.170
long as you're careful.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.750
If you accidentally chose your
two vectors parallel to each

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.490
other, that wouldn't work.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.610
You'd just get 0 here,
and that's no good.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.230
But, so you have to choose two
non-parallel vectors in the

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.380
plane in order to
make this work.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.340
In the third case, you
have three points.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.190
And so with three points what
you can do is you can choose

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.510
two vectors connecting
some of those points.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.500
And that gives you two vectors
that lie in the plane, and

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.280
that reduces to the case of the
previous part, and then

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.830
again, you can take
a cross product to

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.050
get a normal vector.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.330
Finally, we did this fourth
problem where we were given a

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.570
plane parallel to it.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.890
And so you can read off the
normal vector from the

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.380
coefficients of x, y, and
z in the equation.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.790
And then either use the very
first method with a point and

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.370
normal vector, or just realize
that you just have to find the

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.030
appropriate value of the
constant so that this point

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.550
actually lies on the plane.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.640
So I'll end there.
