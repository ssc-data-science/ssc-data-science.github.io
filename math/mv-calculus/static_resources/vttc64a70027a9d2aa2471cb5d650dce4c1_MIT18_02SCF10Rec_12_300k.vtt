00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.790
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.700
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.720
You've been learning in lecture
about matrices and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.680
their various applications, and
one of them is to solving

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.490
systems of linear equations.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.370
So I have here a system
of three linear

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.690
equations for you.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.490
2x plus cz equals 4, x minus y
plus 2z equals pi, and x minus

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
2y plus 2z equals minus 12.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790
So what I'd like you to
do is the following.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.080
Find the value of c--
or all values of c--

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.240
for which, first of all, there's
a unique solution to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.010
this system.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.140
Second of all, for which the
corresponding homogeneous

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.790
system has a unique solution.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.250
So remember that the
corresponding homogeneous

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330
system is the system where you
just replace these constants

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.620
on the right by 0.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.310
So it's a very similar-looking
system.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.910
The left-hand sides are all the
same, but the right-hand

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.170
sides are replaced with 0.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.275
So you want to find the value of
c for which this system has

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.450
a unique solution, the value
of c for which the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.510
corresponding homogeneous system
has a unique solution,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.020
and also the values of c for
which the corresponding

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.310
homogeneous system has
infinitely many solutions.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.960
Note that I'm not asking you
to solve this system of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.790
equations, although you're
welcome to do so if you like.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.430
Although, of course, whether you
can or not might depend on

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.850
the value of c.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.590
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.490
work out the solutions to these
three questions, come

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.970
back, and we can work
it out together.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.580
So hopefully you have some
luck working out these

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.860
problems. Let's start working
through them together.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.590
So I'm actually going to
take parts a and b

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.040
together at the same time.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.550
And the reason that I'm going
to do that is that one thing

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.768
you've learned is that a system
has a unique solution

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:00.018
for, on the right-hand
side-- sorry--

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.260
a system has a unique solution,
like this, a square

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.670
system of linear equations has
a unique solution if and only

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.900
if it has a unique solution
regardless of what the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.070
right-hand side is.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.470
So in particular, the answer to
a and the answer to b are

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.870
exactly the same.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.760
So values of c for which this
system has a unique solution

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480
are exactly the same as values
of c for which the homogeneous

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.940
system has a unique solution.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.750
Now the solutions will be
different, of course.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.850
But the value of c--
or the value of c--

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.410
that make it solvable uniquely,
make it solvable

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.660
uniquely for all right-hand
sides.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.210
And so which values
of c are those?

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.340
Well, those are the values of
c for which the coefficient

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.070
matrix on the left-hand
side is invertible.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.140
So if the coefficient matrix
on the left-hand side is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.970
invertible, then we can solve
this system and we get a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.040
unique solution.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.820
If it's not invertible, then
either we can't solve this

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.170
system-- like there
are no solutions--

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.170
or we can solve this system,
but there are

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.780
infinitely many solutions.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.890
So in both questions a and b,
we're asking for the value of

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.450
c for which the coefficient
matrix of the left-hand side

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.960
is invertible, and that
will be when we

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.270
have a unique solution.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.780
So how do we know when a
matrix is invertible?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.620
Well, let's write down what the
matrix is first of all.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.840
So this matrix M that we're
after is equal to the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.460
matrix 2, 0, c.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.940
1, minus 1, 2.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.290
1, minus 2, 2.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.050
So this is the coefficient
matrix M of that system, and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.650
we want to know for which values
of c is it invertible.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.640
Well, when is a matrix
invertible?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.780
A matrix is invertible-- square
matrix is invertible--

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.310
precisely when it has non-zero
determinant.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.610
So we just need to look at the
determinant of this matrix.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.490
So you've learned how to
compute determinants of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.740
matrices, I think.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.650
So let's, in this case, we have
the det M. So it's a sum

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.490
or difference of six different
terms, and you could get it,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.810
for example, by the Laplace
expansion if you wanted to.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.030
So I'm just going to write out
what the six terms are.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:28.900
So it's 2 times minus 1 times
2, plus 0 times 2 times 1,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:40.590
plus c times 1 times minus 2,
minus c times minus 1 times 1,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:50.900
minus 2 times minus 2 times 2,
minus 0 times 1 times 2.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.530
So this is the determinant
of this matrix.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.380
You can get it either just by
remembering which terms are

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.220
which and which get a plus sign
and which get a minus

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.250
sign, or by doing the Laplace
expansion, or by whatever

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.600
other tricks you might
happen to know.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.100
So now we need to know whether
or not this determinant is 0.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.190
So let's work out
what this is.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.330
So this is-- let me start
simplifying it.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.060
So this is minus 4
plus 0 minus 2c--

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.775
this is minus minus c--

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:22.560
so plus c--

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.270
this is minus minus 8--

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.168
so plus 8, which is equal
to 4 minus c.

00:05:29.168 --> 00:05:32.910
So the determinant-- right, two
of those terms are 0, and

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.810
so I just get to
leave them out.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.900
So the determinant of this
matrix is 4 minus c.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.940
And what we're interested
in is when this

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.820
determinant is non-zero.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:57.510
So in particular, for c not
equal to 0-- sorry, for c not

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.560
equal to 4, when c is not 4--

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.510
the determinant of M is not 0.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:13.120
So when c is not 4, determinant
of M is not 0, so

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.050
both systems-- both the original
system and the

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.210
corresponding homogeneous
system--

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:33.170
have a unique solution.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.110
So when c is not 4--

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.090
so for most values of c--

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.140
the determinant is not
0, and the system

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.530
has a unique solution.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.150
So when c is equal to
4, what happens?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.900
Well, when c is equal to 4,
we're in the bottom case.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.980
We're in the case where the
homogeneous system has

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.960
infinitely many solutions.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.470
OK?

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.640
So let me write that
over here.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.670
When c equals 4--

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.280
I'm going to abbreviate
again--

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.810
the homogeneous system has--

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.140
I'm going to use this symbol--

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.470
this sort of sideways eight
symbol means infinity, so I'm

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:26.660
going to use it for infinitely
many solutions.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.230
So when c is 4, the homogeneous
system has

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.420
infinitely many solutions.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.640
And you might be curious-- well,
so let me say one more

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.240
thing about that.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.820
We know when the coefficient
matrix isn't invertible that

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.960
the system either has 0 or
infinitely many solutions.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.160
But the homogeneous system
always has a solution.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.860
It always has the solution where
everything is all 0.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.180
Right?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.060
So that's why we know that it's
infinitely many here.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.100
And one thing you might ask is
can you find any others?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:08:00.280
Can you find any solutions
that aren't just 0, 0, 0?

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.690
And the answer is yes.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.680
So this is now going beyond when
I asked you to do, but I

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.645
think it's, you know, an
interesting thing to see.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.570
So if you wanted
to find another

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.740
solution, what do you know?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.840
Well, let's go back to the
equations that we had.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.570
So when we're dealing with
a homogeneous system, the

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.850
right-hand sides are 0.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.850
So I'm just going to cross out
these right-hand sides and

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.280
replace them with 0 so we
don't get confused.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.950
So this is 0, 0, and 0.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:39.600
So we're dealing with this
system: 2x plus cz equals 0, x

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.140
minus y plus 2z equals 0, and
x minus 2y plus 2z equals 0.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.460
OK, so if you want
a solution--

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.550
x, y, z--

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.380
to this system, what
do you know?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.300
Well, from the second equation,
you know that the

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.650
vector xyz is orthogonal to
the vector 1, minus 1, 2.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.540
How do you know that?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.960
Because this left-hand side, x
minus y plus 2z, is equal to

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.350
xyz dot 1, minus 1, 2.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.960
And similarly from the third
equation, you know that the

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.310
vector xyz is orthogonal to
the vector 1, minus 2, 2,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.940
because this left-hand
side is equal to xyz

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.160
dot 1, minus 2, 2.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.040
Yeah?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.700
And that's equal to 0.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.680
So from the second and third
equations, you know that

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.720
you're looking for a vector
that's orthogonal to both x--

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.070
or sorry-- both 1, minus 1,
2, and 1, minus 2, 2.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.580
How do you get a vector
perpendicular

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.840
to two known vectors?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.510
Well, you just take their
cross product.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.110
So let's go back over here.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:10:05.910
So to find one, you take a cross
product of two rows of

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.380
the coefficient matrix.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.310
So in this case, for example,
we can take these rows 1,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.210
minus 1, 2, and 1, minus 2, 2.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.135
So, for example, the vector
1, minus 1, 2--

00:10:18.135 --> 00:10:18.750
OK--

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:24.750
cross the vector
1, minus 2, 2.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.715
Now I've kind of run out of
board space, so I'm not going

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:29.260
to work out precisely what
this vector is for you.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.090
But if you like, you can
certainly check.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.480
You can compute this cross
product out with our nice

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.850
formula for the cross product.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.670
It will give you some vector,
and then you can check that

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.230
that vector is indeed
a solution of

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.640
the homogeneous system.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.330
So that will give us a
second solution of

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.200
the homogeneous system.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.140
Nontrivial we say, because it's
not just the 0 solution.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.090
So to quickly recap, we had a
system of linear equations.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.380
I've now crossed out what the
original right-hand side was.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.870
We had a system of linear
equations, and we were looking

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.910
for a choice of c for which
that system had a unique

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.700
solution and for which the
corresponding homogeneous

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.340
system had a unique solution.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.600
And the values of c that make
that work are precisely the

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.660
values of c such that the
coefficient matrix has a

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.030
non-zero determinant.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.975
So that's true for both
parts a and b.

00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:22.920
And for part c, when we were
looking for what values of c

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.700
give the homogeneous system
infinitely many solutions, the

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.150
answer is any other
value of c.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.110
Any value of c for which the
coefficient matrix does have 0

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.772
determinant will give you
infinitely many solutions in

00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:40.660
the homogeneous case, and in
non-homogeneous cases will

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.630
either give you 0 solutions or
infinitely many solutions.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.760
And then we also at the end, we
briefly discussed one way

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.440
to find nontrivial solutions in
the homogeneous case when

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.180
there are infinitely
many solutions.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.990
So I'll end there.
