00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

JOE LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,650
My name is Joe Lewis.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,250
At the time of this filming in
2010 I'm a graduate student

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,610
in the Math Department at MIT,
and I'm also a TA for OCW

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,040
Scholar 1801 and 1802.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,510
CHRISTINE BREINER: Hi.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm Christine Breiner.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm a Moore Instructor here at
MIT and for OCW Scholar, I'll

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,535
be a teaching assistant
for 1801 and for 1802.

11
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:30,840
DAVID JORDAN: My name is David
Jordan and I'm a graduate

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,400
student here at MIT.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,910
And I'm a TA for OpenCourseWare
Scholar 1802.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,020
So I thought I would say a
little bit about what we do

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,860
with recitations here at MIT.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,770
So, the purpose of the
recitations is for you to

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,810
apply what you've learned in
lecture towards solving

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,400
specific concrete problems and
then for you to compare your

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,470
solutions to those problems
with those of your TA.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,270
CHRISTINE BREINER: The purpose
of the recitations on OCW

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,465
Scholar is really the same
purpose that David described

22
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:03,600
for recitations here at MIT.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,140
What we want you to do is have
an opportunity to work varying

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,370
levels of problems and then see
us give detailed solutions

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,660
to those problems so that you
can see how we think about

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,725
mathematics.

27
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,780
JOE LEWIS: Almost all of our
videos have a natural moment

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,530
where you can pause after the
problem's been stated.

29
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,860
And we really strongly suggest
you work out the problem on a

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,120
piece of paper before going back
to the video and seeing

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,020
our solutions.

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,420
This will help you do
mathematics rather than be

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,850
able just to see mathematics.

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,820
Hope you enjoy the course.

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,228
