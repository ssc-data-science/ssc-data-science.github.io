CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:11.710
In this video, what I'd like us
to do is work on understanding

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.287
simply connected regions
in three dimensions.

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:15.870
Well, there's one
two-dimensional one,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.620
but the rest are
three dimensions.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.470
So what I want you
to do is for each

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.880
of the following-- there are six
different regions-- determine

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.310
whether or not each of
them is simply connected.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.290
So the first one is R^3.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.420
The second one is if I take R^3
and I remove the entire z-axis.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.800
The third one is if I
take R3 and I remove 0.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.025
The fourth one is if I take
R^3 and remove a circle.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.640
The fifth one is R^2
minus a line segment.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.410
And the sixth one
is a solid torus.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.880
So a solid torus
looks like a doughnut,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.770
and it includes the
inside of the doughnut.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.830
This looks like a doughnut,
hopefully, to you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.420
And it's not hollow.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.854
It includes the inside.

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.270
So what I'd like
you to do, again,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.311
is determine whether or
not each of these regions

00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.030
is simply connected.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.407
And why don't you pause the
video while you work on that.

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:09.240
And then bring the video
back up when you're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.281
ready to check your work.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.974
OK, welcome back.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.640
So again, what we're
interested in doing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.910
is understanding
simply connectedness

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.330
in another dimension.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.290
We did something
already, a while back,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.130
with two dimensions,
and so now we

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.690
want to understand it
better in three dimensions.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.834
So let's work through these.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.250
Well, I'm not going to write
anything down for number one,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.220
because you should already know
that R^3 is simply connected.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.900
But if you weren't sure
about it, you could think,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.340
any closed curve I draw in
R^3, I can certainly get all

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.100
of the inside of it
contained in R^3.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850
Another way to think about it
is that I can take that curve

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.660
and I can collapse it down to
a point, and remain in R^3.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.760
So then the first one is an easy
yes to simply connectedness.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.260
OK?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.634
So let's start on
the second one,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:06.750
and I'm going to draw a
little picture for us.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.860
So the second one is R^3.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.650
I should go this way.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.916
This is x, y, and z, but then
I remove the entire z-axis.

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.290
So I should make
this really dark

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.280
so we know we're removing
that part from R3.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.740
And I'm removing
it all the way up

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.820
to minus infinity
in the z-direction

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.840
and plus infinity
in the z-direction.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.400
Now, the question is can
I find any closed curve,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.080
that when I try and compress
that closed curve down

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.740
to a point, I can't
do it while remaining

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.830
inside this region that is
all of R3 minus the z-axis.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.020
And the answer is
there is a whole family

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.000
of curves that do this.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.710
If I take a curve that
goes around the z-axis,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.616
you'll notice that there's
something on the inside of it,

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:59.740
regardless of-- you know,
if I slide it up or down,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.020
there's a point on the
inside of this curve that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.960
is not in the region
I'm interested in.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.720
The region, again, is
R^3 minus the z-axis.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.470
So there are two ways
to think about this.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.380
You can think about, if
I were to take this curve

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.165
and I were to put a
surface across this curve,

00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:16.930
so it was like a
disk, there would

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.760
be a point on the z-axis
that would intersect it.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.010
Or you can think about it
as saying, I have this curve

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.790
and if I try and squeeze it down
to as small as I can get it,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.460
I can't get it as small
is I want without hitting

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.010
the z-axis at some point.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.930
The z-axis is kind
of in the way, right?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.650
Now, number three is a
little different situation.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.142
Because in number three, I
think this exact same picture,

00:03:42.142 --> 00:03:43.850
but instead of removing
the whole z-axis,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.940
I just remove the origin.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.648
So let me try and draw
a picture of that.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.340
So I'm going to
make this-- there's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.740
a big open circle at the origin.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.120
That's not included in
our domain, in our region.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.560
So our region is all of
R^3 except the origin.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.520
And in two-dimensional space,
this was not simply connected.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.860
But in three-dimensional
space it is simply connected.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.930
So this is a little
different situation

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.570
than what you had previously.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.930
And so the idea is
here, if I take a curve,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.030
even if I take a curve that's
sitting in the xy-plane that

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.300
goes around the
origin, the point

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.960
is I can keep this curve
in three-dimensional space,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.610
and I can wiggle it around,
so that I can shrink it down

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.840
to a point, and the origin
doesn't get in the way.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.350
It doesn't keep me
from doing that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840
So actually, this region, even
though in two-dimensional space

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.620
it was not simply connected, in
three-dimensional space it is.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.120
And let's see if we
understand the difference.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.170
The difference is in
two-dimensional space,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.340
if I drew a curve on the
xy-plane around the origin,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.504
and I wanted to squish it
down to a point, the only way

00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:53.420
to do that would be to
bring the curve somehow

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.880
through the origin.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.380
Right?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.970
I would be stuck having to pass
the curve through the origin

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.090
to shrink it down to a point.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.490
But in three-space, I
have another dimension.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.460
So a curve that sits
on the xy-plane,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.470
I can just kind of
lift it a little bit

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.700
away from the origin, and then
I can shrink it down to a point

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.740
without the origin
getting in the way.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.550
So having that extra
dimension means

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.450
even though I remove
one point, it's

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.030
still actually a simply
connected region.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.110
So maybe this is
the first place we

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.120
see that in the
three dimensions we

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.510
have a different case than
we had in two dimensions,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.334
removing the same
kind of object.

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.750
So I realize now I haven't
been writing down whether these

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.250
are simply connected or not.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.640
So I should write down
this is simply connected.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.030
And maybe for number two I
should go back and formally

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.200
write not simply connected.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.880
So that we have
this for posterity.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.910
Now the fourth one is
R^3 minus a circle.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.830
So let me see if I can
draw a picture of that.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.909
And the circle, it doesn't
really matter where it is.

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.450
I'm just going to
draw one somewhere.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.930
So here's my circle.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.430
So everything is in my
region except this circle.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.710
And the question: is
it simply connected?

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.940
And the answer
is: no, the region

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.267
is not simply connected, because
of one particular problem.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:15.850
It's actually the
same kind of problem

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.010
you have when you
remove the z-axis.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.610
And that is, if I draw a curve
that goes around this circle--

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.220
any curve that goes around
this circle-- notice

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.160
that any way I try
and move this curve

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.630
and shrink it down to
a point, this circle

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.450
is going to get in the
way for the same reason

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.110
that the z-axis got in the way.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.190
Because this circle
is closed, I can't

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.060
slide the curve I'm interested
in away from the circle

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.480
and then shrink it down.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.300
OK.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.949
There's some sort of
obstruction right here.

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.990
And so it's fundamentally
different than the case

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.531
where we just had the origin,
because we could take any curve

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:57.320
and we could move it
away from the origin,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.800
and then shrink it
down to a point.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.430
And the origin didn't
get in the way.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.640
But here, anywhere I
try and move this curve,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.640
it's going to have to
hit the circle if I

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.760
want to move it away
so I can shrink it

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.320
to a point in my region.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.600
So this circle is preventing
me from shrinking it down.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.990
OK, and then there are two more.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.006
And the fifth one is R^2
minus a line segment.

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:23.850
So now we're in
two-dimensional space.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.660
OK, and let me just
pick a segment.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.120
OK.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.730
Now, this one is interesting.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.230
Oops.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.919
Again I did it.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.210
I forgot to write whether
it's simply connected or not.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.890
Let me come back over
to four for posterity.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.410
Not simply connected.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.440
OK, sorry about that.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.530
The fifth one, because
I'm in two dimensions,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.380
it's going to be not
simply connected,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.060
but if I add a
third dimension, it

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.990
would become simply connected.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.630
So I want to explain why it's
not simply connected here,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.330
and then I want to show you
why in a third dimension

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.830
it becomes simply connected.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.870
OK?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.230
The problem curves
are the curves

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.400
that do this, that go
around this line segment.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.010
Because notice, if I want to
try and contract this curve down

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.565
to a point and I don't want to
intersect that line segment,

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:17.690
in order to do it I'd
actually have to move it away

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.630
from the line segment.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.410
I'd have to pass through
the line segment.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.310
At some point, this curve
would intersect that segment

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.900
in order to be able to shrink
it to a point in the region I'm

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.900
interested in.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.040
So this segment is
getting in the way--

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.940
we can think of it that way--
of allowing me to contract this

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.920
down to a point.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.350
Actually also, when we talked
about simply connectedness

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.990
in two dimensions,
it was easier.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.930
Because we could say,
if we take any curve

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:48.202
and we look at the disk that's
spanned by this curve-- where

00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:50.410
the boundary is this curve,
and we look at the region

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.510
the curve encloses-- notice that
this segment is in that region.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.780
And there's no way of
drawing this kind of curve

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.930
without the segment
being in that region,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.830
and that's how we know
it's not simply connected.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.487
Now, in three
dimensions, what happens?

00:09:04.487 --> 00:09:06.070
What if I took this
exact same picture

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.680
and I just made the z-axis
come out from the board?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.900
Why is that suddenly
simply connected,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.250
whereas in the
two-dimensional case it's not?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.310
And the reason is because
in this same picture,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.920
I could take this
same curve, and I

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.760
could take this
shaded thing, and I

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.070
could push the shaded
thing out of the xy-plane.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.480
And so I'd still have
the same boundary curve,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.180
but I'd have the shaded portion
not hitting the segment.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.260
And so I can find some
surface with this boundary

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.680
that doesn't have this segment
in the interior of the surface.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.750
And that's another
way of thinking

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.480
about simply connectedness.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.060
So in the two-dimensional case,
it is not simply connected,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.910
but if I were to add
a third dimension,

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.160
this region would
become simply connected.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.660
OK.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.620
Because I would have no
problem for any curve finding

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.430
some surface that had
that curve as a boundary

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.060
that didn't intersect
that segment.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.791
So I could keep the surface in
the region I was interested in.

00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:06.290
OK.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.206
So that would tell me
it was simply connected.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:10.990
And then the last
one is a solid torus.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.250
OK, and this one, we might
not have dealt with solid tori

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.710
before, but this is an
interesting problem.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.640
OK, so there are
fundamentally-- we

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.750
say in math-- that there
are two classes of curves

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.860
that are interesting.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.980
We won't get into the
exact terminology of what's

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
happening, but there are two
types of curves on the torus.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.471
One type of curve is the kind
that goes around right here.

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:37.970
OK.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.980
So it loops around the
doughnut in that direction.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.440
But that type of curve
is nice, because notice,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.240
that if I look at
the surface in there,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.550
it's all inside the solid torus.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.470
So that's good.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.510
So that seems like
that's a curve that

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.760
promotes simply connectedness.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.200
Or it's not telling us
it's not simply connected.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.670
We'll say that.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.810
But there's another class
of curves in the torus.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.000
And that's the class of
curves that goes around--

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.590
this is a little harder to
draw, but say around the top,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.640
but around the hole.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.450
OK?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.640
Around the hole.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.630
Now any surface
I have that I try

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.880
to draw-- any
surface that's going

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.210
to have that curve
as a boundary-- is

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.650
at some point forced to
leave the solid torus.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.280
And the reason is really because
of the hole in the middle.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.780
Right?

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.170
That's really the
reason it happens.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.270
OK.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.140
And so you can see
the part right in here

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.820
is on the surface, but it's
not in the solid torus.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.780
So because I have a
curve that any surface

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.410
I draw that has that
curve as a boundary is

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.290
forced to leave the
solid torus, it's

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.540
a non-simply-connected region.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.870
So we say not simply connected.

00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:02.000
OK.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.120
So I'm going to go back through
real quickly and just remind us

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.160
what was happening.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.107
And maybe use the language
I was using at the end

00:12:10.107 --> 00:12:11.940
to describe the first
examples, because that

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.064
might help a little better.

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.290
So let's go back to
the first examples.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.730
OK, in the R^3 example,
again, number one,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.610
we know it's simply connected.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.420
We're not going
to worry about it.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.000
OK.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.760
But let me draw--
in number two, maybe

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.312
if I draw some
shaded region, this

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.270
will help us understand
it a little bit better.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.790
Number two we established
was not simply connected.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.550
And if you think
about it, if you

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.390
have a curve that goes
around the z-axis,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.540
and you want to look
at a surface that

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.370
has that curve as its boundary,
this surface certainly

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.504
intersects the z-axis.

00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:43.420
The question is, can I
keep this curve the way

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.380
it is, and pull the surface
away and have it not

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.910
intersect the z-axis?

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.140
And the answer is no.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.430
Any way I move the
inside of the curve--

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.890
basically, what looks
like a disk-- it's still

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.120
going to intersect
the z-axis somewhere.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.710
Right?

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.140
And so it's definitely
not simply connected.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.330
And the thing I was trying
to point out in number three,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.350
that it is simply
connected, is if I

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.840
shade the boundary of a curve
sitting in the xy-plane,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.840
and then I take that shaded
disk and I push it up a little,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.110
then it no longer
hits the origin.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.970
And I haven't fundamentally
changed my curve at all.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.680
And so that's a way of
understanding that it

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.470
is actually simply connected.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.970
OK?

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.810
So there are a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.194
And without being incredibly
mathematically precise,

00:13:35.194 --> 00:13:36.610
these are some of
the best ways we

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.220
have of thinking about
understanding simply connected

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.930
or not simply connected.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.150
So again, we had six examples.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.110
Removing the z-axis from R^3
was not simply connected.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:53.120
Removing the origin from R^3
was still simply connected.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.910
Removing a circle from R^3
was not simply connected

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.720
for the same reason
as the z-axis problem,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.000
because here was my disk, and
any way I try to move this

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.240
shaded surface, I can't keep it
from intersecting this circle.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.946
And then number five
was R^2 minus a segment.

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:18.975
It was not simply connected,
but if I add another dimension,

00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:22.090
it is simply connected, for the
same kind of reason that R^3

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.110
minus the origin was.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.120
And then number six
was the solid torus.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.060
Which now, it's kind
of hard to see what

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.920
the solid torus looks like.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.230
But we said, there's one kind
of curve that behaves fine,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.030
but the curve that goes
all the way around the hole

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.360
shows it's, in fact,
not simply connected.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.350
So hopefully that
was informative,

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.140
and that's where I'll stop.
