7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
We are going to continue to
look at stuff in space.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
We have been working with
triple integrals and seeing how

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
to set them up in all sorts of
coordinate systems.

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:49
And the next topic we will be
looking at are vector fields in

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
space.
And so, in particular,

12
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
we will be learning about flux
and work.

13
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
So, just for a change,
we will be starting with flux

14
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
first.
And we will do work,

15
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
actually, after Thanksgiving.
Just to remind you,

16
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
a vector field in space is just
the same thing as in the plane.

17
00:01:08 --> 00:01:19
At every point you have a
vector, and the components of

18
00:01:19 --> 00:01:26
this vector depend on the
coordinates x,

19
00:01:26 --> 00:01:34
y and z.
Let's say the components might

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:42
be P, Q, R, or your favorite
three letters,

21
00:01:42 --> 00:01:53
where each of these things is a
function of coordinates x,

22
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
y, z.
You have seen that in the plane

23
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
it is already pretty hard to
draw a vector field.

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
Usually, in space,
we won't really try too hard.

25
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
But it is still useful to try
to have a general idea for what

26
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
the vectors in there are doing,
whether they are all going in

27
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
the same direction,
whether they may be all

28
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
vertical or horizontal,
pointing away from the origin, 

29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
towards it, 
things like that.

30
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
But, generally-speaking,
we won't really bother with

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
trying to draw a picture because
that is going to be quite hard.

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
Just to give you examples,
well, the same kinds of

33
00:02:30 --> 00:02:37
examples as the plane,
you can think of force fields.

34
00:02:37 --> 00:02:48
For example,
the gravitational attraction --

35
00:02:48 --> 00:03:01
-- of a solid mass,
let's call this mass big M,

36
00:03:01 --> 00:03:13
at the origin on a mass M at
point x, y, z.

37
00:03:13 --> 00:03:20
That would be given by a vector
field that points toward the

38
00:03:20 --> 00:03:27
origin and whose magnitude is
inversely proportional to the

39
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
square of a distance from the
origin.

40
00:03:31 --> 00:03:39
Such a field would be directed
towards the origin and its

41
00:03:39 --> 00:03:47
magnitude would be of the order
of a constant over pho squared

42
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
where pho is the distance from
the origin.

43
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
The picture,
if I really wanted to draw a

44
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
picture, would be everywhere it
is a field that points towards

45
00:04:02 --> 00:04:09
the origin.
And if I am further away then

46
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
it gets smaller.
And, of course,

47
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
I am not going to try to draw
all these vectors in there.

48
00:04:16 --> 00:04:27
If I wanted to give a formula
for that -- A formula for that

49
00:04:27 --> 00:04:36
might be something of a form
minus c times x,

50
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
y, z over pho cubed.
Let's see.

51
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Well, the direction of this
vector, this vector is

52
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
proportional to negative x,
y, z.

53
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
 
 

54
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
is the vector that goes from
the origin to your point.

55
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
The negative goes towards the
origin.

56
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
Then the magnitude of this guy,
well, the magnitude of x,

57
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
y, z is just the distance from
the origin rho.

58
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
So the magnitude of this thing
is one over rho cubed times some

59
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
constant factor.
That would be an example of a

60
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
vector field that comes up in
physics.

61
00:05:14 --> 00:05:20
Well, other examples would be
electric fields.

62
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Actually, if you look at the
electric field generated by a

63
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
charged particle at the origin,
it is given by exactly the same

64
00:05:27 --> 00:05:36
kind of formula,
and there are magnetic fields

65
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
and so on.
Another example comes from

66
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
velocity fields.
If you have a fluid flow,

67
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
for example,
if you want to study wind

68
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
patterns in the atmosphere.
Well, wind, most of the time,

69
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
is kind of horizontal,
but maybe it depends on the

70
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
altitude.
At high altitude you have jet

71
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
streams, and the wind velocity
is not the same at all

72
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
altitudes.
And, just to give you more

73
00:06:08 --> 00:06:15
examples, in math we have seen
that the gradient of a function

74
00:06:15 --> 00:06:21
of three variables gives you a
vector field.

75
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
If you have a function u of x,
y, z then its gradient field

76
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
has just components,
u sub x, u sub y and u sub z.

77
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
And, of course,
the cases are not mutually

78
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
exclusive.
For example,

79
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
the electric field or
gravitational field is given by

80
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
the gradient of the
gravitational or electric

81
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
potential.
So, these are not like

82
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
different cases.
There is overlap.

83
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
Anyway, hopefully,
you are kind of convinced that

84
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
you should learn about vector
fields.

85
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
What are we going to do with
them?

86
00:06:59 --> 00:07:16
Well, let's start with flux.
Remember not so long ago we

87
00:07:16 --> 00:07:24
looked at flux of a
two-dimensional field of a

88
00:07:24 --> 00:07:32
curve.
We had a curve in the plane and

89
00:07:32 --> 00:07:41
we had a vector field.
And we looked at the component

90
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
of a vector field in the
direction that was normal to the

91
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
curve.
We formed the flux integral

92
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
that was a line integral F dot n
ds.

93
00:07:54 --> 00:07:59
And that measured how much the
vector field was going across

94
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
the curve.
If you were thinking of a

95
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
velocity field,
that would measure how much

96
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
fluid is passing through the
curve in unit time.

97
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
Now let's say that we were in
space.

98
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
Well, we cannot really think of
flux as a line integral.

99
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
Because, if you have a curve in
space and say that you have wind

100
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
or something like that,
you cannot really ask how much

101
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
air is flowing through the
curve.

102
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
See, to have a flow through
something you need a surface.

103
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
If you have a net maybe then
you can ask how much stuff is

104
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
passing through that surface.
There is going to be a big

105
00:08:37 --> 00:08:44
difference here.
In the three-dimensional space,

106
00:08:44 --> 00:08:51
flux will be measured through a
surface.

107
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
And so it will be a surface
integral, not a line integral

108
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
anymore.
That means we will be

109
00:08:59 --> 00:09:10
integrating, we will be summing
over all the pieces of a surface

110
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
in space.
Because a surface is a

111
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
two-dimensional object,
that will end up being a double

112
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
integral.
But, of course,

113
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
we will have to set it up
properly because the surface

114
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
that is in space,
and we will probably have x,

115
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
y and z to deal with at the
same time,

116
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
and we will have to somehow get
rid of one variable so that we

117
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
can set up and evaluate a double
integral.

118
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
So conceptually it is very
similar to line integrals.

119
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
In the line integral in the
plane, you had two variables

120
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
that you reduced to one by
figuring out what the curve was.

121
00:09:42 --> 00:09:51
Here you have three variables
that you will reduce to two by

122
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
figuring out what the surface
is.

123
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
Let me give you a definition of
flux in 3D.

124
00:10:00 --> 00:10:15
Let's say that we have a vector
field and s, a surface in space.

125
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
Let me draw some kind of a
picture.

126
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
I have my surface and I have my
vector field F.

127
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
Well, at every point it changes
with a point.

128
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Well, I want to figure out how
much my vector field is going

129
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
across that surface.
That means I want to figure out

130
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
the normal component of my
vector field,

131
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
so I will use,
as in the plane case,

132
00:10:45 --> 00:10:53
the unit normal vector to s.
I take my point on the surface

133
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
and build a unit vector that is
standing on it perpendicularly.

134
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
Now, we have to decide which
way it is standing.

135
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
We can build our normal vector
to go this way or to go the

136
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
other way around.
There are two choices.

137
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
Basically, whenever you want to
set up a flux integral you have

138
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
to choose one side of the
surface.

139
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
And you will count positively
what flows toward that side and

140
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
negatively what flows towards
the other side.

141
00:11:26 --> 00:11:40
There are two choices for n.
We need to choose a side of the

142
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
surface.
In the case of curves, 

143
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
we made that choice by deciding
that because we were going along

144
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
some direction on the curve we
could choose one side by saying

145
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
let's rotate clockwise from the
tangent vector.

146
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
And, in a way,
what we were doing was really

147
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
it was a recipe to choose for us
one of the two sides.

148
00:12:04 --> 00:12:09
Here we don't have a notion of
orienting the surface other than

149
00:12:09 --> 00:12:14
by precisely choosing one of the
two possible normal vectors.

150
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
So, in fact,
this is called choosing an

151
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
orientation of a surface.
When you are saying you are

152
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
orienting the surface that
really means you are deciding

153
00:12:22 --> 00:12:31
which side is which.
Let's call that orientation.

154
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
Now, there is no set convention
that will work forever.

155
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
But the usually traditional
settings would be to take your

156
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
normal vector pointing maybe out
of the solid region because then

157
00:12:43 --> 00:12:48
you will be looking at flux that
is coming out of that region of

158
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
space.
Or, if you have a surface that

159
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
is not like closed or anything
but maybe you will want the flux

160
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
going up through the region.
Or, there are various

161
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
conventions.
Concretely, on problem sets it

162
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
will either say which choice you
have to make or you get to

163
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
choose which one you want to
make.

164
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
And, of course,
if you choose the other one

165
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
then the sign becomes the
opposite.

166
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
Now, once we have made a choice
then we can define the flux

167
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
integral.
It will just be the double

168
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
integral over a surface of F dot
n dS.

169
00:13:26 --> 00:13:33
Now I am using a big dS.
That stands for the surface

170
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
area element on this surface.
I am using dS rather than dA

171
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
because I still want to think of
dA as maybe the area in one of

172
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
the coordinate planes like the
one we had in double integrals.

173
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
You will see later where this
comes in.

174
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
But conceptually it is very
similar.

175
00:13:54 --> 00:13:59
Concretely what this means is I
cut my surface into little

176
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
pieces.
Each of them has area delta S.

177
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
And, for each piece, 
I take my vector field, 

178
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
I take my normal vector, 
I dot them and I multiply by

179
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
this surface area and sum all
these things together.

180
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
That is what a double integral
means.

181
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
In particular,
an easy case where you know you

182
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
can get away without computing
anything is, of course,

183
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
if your vector field is tangent
to the surface because then you

184
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
know that there is no flux.
Flux is going to be zero

185
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
because nothing passes through
the surface.

186
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
Otherwise, we have to figure
out how to compute these things.

187
00:14:42 --> 00:14:50
That is what we are going to
learn now.

188
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
Well, maybe I should box this
formula.

189
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
I have noticed that some of you
seem to like it when I box the

190
00:14:57 --> 00:15:03
important formulas.
(APPLAUSE) By the way,

191
00:15:03 --> 00:15:12
a piece of notation before I
move on, sometimes you will also

192
00:15:12 --> 00:15:18
see the notation vector dS.
What is vector dS?

193
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
Vector dS is this guy n dS put
together.

194
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
Vector dS is a vector which
points perpendicular to the

195
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
surface and whose length
corresponds to the surface

196
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
element.
And the reason for having this

197
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
shortcut notation,
well, it is not only laziness

198
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
like saving one n,
but it is because this guy is

199
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
very often easier to compute
than it is to set up n and dS

200
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
separately.
Actually, if you remember in

201
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
the plane, we have seen that
vector n little ds can be

202
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
written directly as dy,
- dx.

203
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
That was easier than finding n
and ds separately.

204
00:16:03 --> 00:16:15
And here the same is going to
be true in many cases.

205
00:16:15 --> 00:16:23
Well, any questions before we
do examples?

206
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
No.
OK.

207
00:16:24 --> 00:16:38
Let's do examples.
The first example for today is

208
00:16:38 --> 00:16:51
we are going to look at the flux
of vector field xi yj xk through

209
00:16:51 --> 00:17:02
the sphere of radius a -- --
centered at the origin.

210
00:17:02 --> 00:17:18
What does the picture look like?
We have a sphere of radius a.

211
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
I have my vector field.
Well, , see, 

212
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
that is a vector field that is
equal to the vector from the

213
00:17:25 --> 00:17:35
origin to the point where I am,
so it is pointing radially away

214
00:17:35 --> 00:17:42
from the origin.
My vector field is really

215
00:17:42 --> 00:17:49
sticking out everywhere away
from the origin.

216
00:17:49 --> 00:17:56
Now I have to find the normal
vector to the sphere if I want

217
00:17:56 --> 00:18:04
to set up double integral over
the sphere of F dot vector ds,

218
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
or if you want F dot n dS.
What does the normal vector to

219
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
the sphere look like?
Well, it depends,

220
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
of course, whether I choose it
pointing out or in.

221
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
Let's say I am choosing it
pointing out then it will be

222
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
sticking straight out of a
sphere as well.

223
00:18:20 --> 00:18:27
Hopefully, you can see that if
I take a normal vector to the

224
00:18:27 --> 00:18:34
sphere it is actually pointing
radially out away from the

225
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
origin.
In fact, our vector field and

226
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
our normal vector are parallel
to each other.

227
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
Let's think a bit more about
what a normal vector looks like.

228
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
I said it is sticking straight
out.

229
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
It is proportional to this
vector field.

230
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
Maybe I should start by writing

231
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52

232
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
because that is the vector that
goes from the origin to my point

233
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
so it points radially away from
the origin.

234
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
Now there is a small problem
with that.

235
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
It is not a unit vector.
So what is its length?

236
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
Well, its length is square root
of x^2 y^2 z^2.

237
00:19:08 --> 00:19:13
But, if I am on the sphere,
then that length is just equal

238
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
to a because distance from the
origin is a.

239
00:19:16 --> 00:19:23
In fact, I get my normal vector
by scaling this guy down by a

240
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
factor of a.
And let me write it down just

241
00:19:27 --> 00:19:34
in case you are still unsure.
This is unit because square

242
00:19:34 --> 00:19:43
root of x^2 y^2 z^2 is equal to
a on the sphere.

243
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
OK.
Any questions about this?

244
00:19:48 --> 00:19:52
No. It looks OK?
I see a lot of blank faces.

245
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
That physics test must have
been hard.

246
00:19:58 --> 00:20:03
Yes?
I could have put a rho but I

247
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
want to emphasize the fact that
here it is going to be a

248
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
constant.
I mean rho has this connotation

249
00:20:09 --> 00:20:13
of being a variable that I will
need to then maybe integrate

250
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
over or do something with.
Yes, it would be correct to put

251
00:20:17 --> 00:20:20
rho but I then later will want
to replace it by its actual

252
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
value which is a number.
And the number is a.

253
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
It is not going to actually
change from point to point.

254
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
For example,
if this was the unit sphere

255
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
then I would just put x,
y, z.

256
00:20:32 --> 00:20:41
I wouldn't divide by anything.
Now let's figure out F dot n.

257
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47
Let's do things one at a time.
Well, F and n are parallel to

258
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
each other.
F dot n, the normal component

259
00:20:53 --> 00:21:00
of F, is actually equal to the
length of F.

260
00:21:00 --> 00:21:05
Well, times the length of n if
you want, but that is going to

261
00:21:05 --> 00:21:09
be a one since F and n are
parallel to each other.

262
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
And what is the magnitude of F
if I am on the sphere?

263
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
Well, the magnitude of F in
general is square root of x^2

264
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
y^2 z^2 on the sphere that is
going be a.

265
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
The other way to do it, 
if you don't want to think

266
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
geometrically like that,
is to just to do the dot

267
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
product x, y,
z doted with x over a,

268
00:21:31 --> 00:21:35
y over a, z over a.
You will be x^2 y^2 z^2 divided

269
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
by a.
That will simplify to a because

270
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
we are on the sphere.
See, we are already using here

271
00:21:45 --> 00:21:47
the relation between x,
y and z.

272
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
We are not letting x,
y and z be completely

273
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
arbitrary.
But the slogan is everything

274
00:21:51 --> 00:21:54
happens on the surface where we
are doing the integral.

275
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
We are not looking at anything
inside or outside.

276
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
We are just on the surface.

277
00:21:58 --> 00:22:34

278
00:22:34 --> 00:22:43
Now what do I do with that?
Well, I have turned my integral

279
00:22:43 --> 00:22:50
into the double integral of a
dS.

280
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
And a is just a constant,
so I am very lucky here.

281
00:22:53 --> 00:22:59
I can just say this will be a
times the double integral of dS.

282
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
And, of course, 
some day I will have to learn

283
00:23:02 --> 00:23:05
how to tackle that beast,
but for now I don't actually

284
00:23:05 --> 00:23:08
need to because the double
integral of dS just means I am

285
00:23:08 --> 00:23:11
summing the area of each little
piece of the sphere.

286
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16
I am just going to get the
total area of the sphere which I

287
00:23:16 --> 00:23:23
know to be 4pi a2.
This guy here is going to be

288
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
the area of S.
I know that to be 4pi a^2.

289
00:23:29 --> 00:23:37
So I will get 4pi a^3.
That one was relatively

290
00:23:37 --> 00:23:44
painless.
That was too easy.

291
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
Let's do a second example with
the same sphere.

292
00:23:49 --> 00:23:56
But now my vector field is
going to be just z times k.

293
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
Well, let me give it a
different name.

294
00:23:58 --> 00:24:04
Let me call it H instead of f
or something like that just so

295
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
that it is not called F anymore.
Well, the initial part of the

296
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
setup is still the same.
The normal vector is still the

297
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
same.
What changes is,

298
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
of course, my vector field is
no longer sticking straight out

299
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
so I cannot use this easy
geometric argument.

300
00:24:18 --> 00:24:22
It looks like I will have to
compute F dot n and then figure

301
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
out how to integrate that with
dS.

302
00:24:24 --> 00:24:36
Let's do that.
We still have that n is <x,

303
00:24:36 --> 00:24:44
y, z>/a.
That tells us that H dot n will

304
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
be 
dot <x, y,

305
00:24:49 --> 00:24:57
z> / a.
It looks like I will be left

306
00:24:57 --> 00:25:10
with z^2 over a.
H dot n is z^2 over a.

307
00:25:10 --> 00:25:18
The double integral for flux
now becomes double integral on

308
00:25:18 --> 00:25:25
the sphere of z^2 over a dS.
Well, we can take out one over

309
00:25:25 --> 00:25:29
a, that is fine,
but it looks like we will have

310
00:25:29 --> 00:25:33
to integrate z^2 on the surface
of the sphere.

311
00:25:33 --> 00:25:37
How do we do that?
Well, we have to figure out

312
00:25:37 --> 00:25:41
what is dS in terms of our
favorite set of two variables

313
00:25:41 --> 00:25:45
that we will use to integrate.
Now, what is the best way to

314
00:25:45 --> 00:25:47
figure out where you are on the
sphere?

315
00:25:47 --> 00:25:51
Well, you could try to use
maybe theta and z.

316
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
If you know how high you are
and where you are around,

317
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
in principle you know where you
are on the sphere.

318
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
But since spherical coordinates
we have actually learned about

319
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
something much more interesting,
namely spherical coordinates.

320
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
It looks like longitude /
latitude is the way to go when

321
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
trying to figure out where you
are on a sphere.

322
00:26:12 --> 00:26:19
We are going to use phi and
theta.

323
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
And, of course,
we have to figure out how to

324
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
express dS in terms of d phi and
d theta.

325
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
Well, if you were paying
really, really close attention

326
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
last time, you will notice that
we have actually already done

327
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41
that.
Last time we saw that if I have

328
00:26:41 --> 00:26:48
a sphere of radius a and I take
a little piece of it that

329
00:26:48 --> 00:26:56
corresponds to small changes in
phi and theta then we said that

330
00:26:56 --> 00:27:01
-- Well,
we argued that this side here, 

331
00:27:01 --> 00:27:08
the one that is going east-west
was a piece of the circle that

332
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
has a radius a sin phi because
that is r,

333
00:27:14 --> 00:27:19
so that side is a sin phi delta
theta.

334
00:27:19 --> 00:27:22
And the side that goes
north-south is a piece of the

335
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
circle of radius a corresponding
to angle delta phi,

336
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
so it is a delta phi.
And so, just to get to the

337
00:27:32 --> 00:27:40
answer, we got dS equals a^2 sin
phi d phi d theta.

338
00:27:40 --> 00:27:45
When we set up a surface
integral on the surface of a

339
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
sphere,
most likely we will be using

340
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
phi and theta as our two
variables of integration and dS

341
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
will become this.
Now, it is OK to think of them

342
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
as spherical coordinates,
but I would like to encourage

343
00:27:58 --> 00:28:01
you not to think of them as
spherical coordinates.

344
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
Spherical coordinates are a way
of describing points in space in

345
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
terms of three variables.
Here it is more like we are

346
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
parameterizing the sphere.
We are finding a parametric

347
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
equation for the sphere using
two variables phi and theta

348
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
which happen to be part of the
spherical coordinate system.

349
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
But, see, there is no rho
involved in here.

350
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
I am not using any rho ever,
and I am not going to in this

351
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
calculation.
I have two variable phi and

352
00:28:28 --> 00:28:37
theta.
That is it.

353
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
It is basically in the same way
as when you parameterize a line

354
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
integral in the circle,
we use theta as the parameter

355
00:28:45 --> 00:28:50
variable and never think about
r.

356
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
That being said,
well, we are going to use phi

357
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
and theta.
We know what dS is.

358
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
We still need to figure out
what z is.

359
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
There we want to think a tiny
bit about spherical coordinates

360
00:29:01 --> 00:29:08
again.
And we will know that z is just

361
00:29:08 --> 00:29:15
a cos phi.
In case you don't quite see it,

362
00:29:15 --> 00:29:25
let me draw a diagram.
Phi is the angle down from the

363
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
positive z axes,
this distance is a,

364
00:29:31 --> 00:29:38
so this distance here is a cos
phi.

365
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
Now I have everything I need to
compute my double integral.

366
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
z^2 over a dS will become a
double integral.

367
00:29:49 --> 00:30:00
z^2 becomes a^2 cos^2 phi over
a times, ds becomes,

368
00:30:00 --> 00:30:07
a^2 sin phi d phi d theta.
Now I need to set up bounds.

369
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
Well, what are the bounds?
Phi goes all the way from zero

370
00:30:12 --> 00:30:19
to pi because we go all the way
from the north pole to the south

371
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
pole, and theta goes from zero
to 2pi.

372
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
And, of course,
I can get rid of some a's in

373
00:30:27 --> 00:30:34
there and take them out.
Let's look at what number we

374
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
get.
First of all,

375
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
we can take out all those a's
and get a^3.

376
00:30:43 --> 00:30:50
Second, in the inner integral,
we are integrating cos^2 phi

377
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
sin phi d phi.
I claim that integrates to cos3

378
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
up to some factor,
and that factor should be

379
00:30:57 --> 00:31:02
negative one-third.
If you look at cos3 phi and you

380
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
take its derivative,
you will get that guy with a

381
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
negative three in front between
zero and pi.

382
00:31:12 --> 00:31:16
And, while integrating over
theta, we will just multiply

383
00:31:16 --> 00:31:24
things by 2pi.
Let me add the 2pi in front.

384
00:31:24 --> 00:31:27
Now, if I evaluate this guy
between zero and pi,

385
00:31:27 --> 00:31:32
well, at pi cos^3 is negative
one, at zero it is one,

386
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
I will get two-thirds out of
this.

387
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
I end up with four-thirds pi
a^3.

388
00:31:39 --> 00:31:46
Sorry I didn't write very much
because I am trying to save

389
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
blackboard space.
Yes?

390
00:31:52 --> 00:31:55
That is a very natural question.
That looks a lot like somebody

391
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
we know, like the volume of a
sphere.

392
00:31:58 --> 00:32:03
And ultimately it will be.
Wait until next class when we

393
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
talk about the divergence
theorem.

394
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
I mean the question was is this
related to the volume of a

395
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
sphere, and ultimately it is,
but for now it is just some

396
00:32:14 --> 00:32:23
coincidence.
Yes?

397
00:32:23 --> 00:32:26
The question is there is a way
to do it M dx plus N dy plus

398
00:32:26 --> 00:32:28
stuff like that?
The answer is unfortunately no

399
00:32:28 --> 00:32:30
because it is not a line
integral.

400
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
It is a surface integral,
so we need to have to variables

401
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38
in there.
In a way you would end up with

402
00:32:38 --> 00:32:41
things like some dx dy maybe and
so on.

403
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
I mean it is not practical to
do it directly that way because

404
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
you would have then to compute
Jacobians to switch from dx dy

405
00:32:49 --> 00:32:52
to something else.
We are going to see various

406
00:32:52 --> 00:32:54
ways of computing it.
Unfortunately,

407
00:32:54 --> 00:32:57
it is not quite as simple as
with line integrals.

408
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
But it is not much harder.
It is the same spirit.

409
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04
We just use two variables and
set up everything in terms of

410
00:33:04 --> 00:33:12
these two variables.
Any other questions?

411
00:33:12 --> 00:33:14
No.
OK.

412
00:33:14 --> 00:33:51
 
 

413
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
By the way, just some food for
thought.

414
00:33:54 --> 00:34:01
Never mind.
Conclusion of looking at these

415
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
two examples is that sometimes
we can use geometric.

416
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
The first example,
we didn't actually have to

417
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
compute an integral.
But most of the time we need to

418
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
learn how to set up double
integrals.

419
00:34:14 --> 00:34:26
Use geometry or you need to set
up for double integral of a

420
00:34:26 --> 00:34:30
surface.
And so we are going to learn

421
00:34:30 --> 00:34:33
how to do that in general.
As I said, we need to have two

422
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
parameters on the surface and
express everything in terms of

423
00:34:37 --> 00:34:43
these.
Let's look at various examples.

424
00:34:43 --> 00:34:46
We are going to see various
situations where we can do

425
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
things.
Well, let's start with an easy

426
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
one.
Let's call that number zero.

427
00:34:53 --> 00:35:02
Say that my surface S is a
horizontal plane,

428
00:35:02 --> 00:35:07
say z equals a.
When I say a horizontal plane,

429
00:35:07 --> 00:35:09
it doesn't have to be the
entire horizontal plane.

430
00:35:09 --> 00:35:14
It could be a small piece of it.
It could even be,

431
00:35:14 --> 00:35:16
to trick you,
maybe an ellipse in there or a

432
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
triangle in there or something
like that.

433
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
What you have to recognize is
my surface is a piece of just a

434
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
flat plane, so I shouldn't worry
too much about what part of a

435
00:35:27 --> 00:35:30
plane it is.
Well, it will become important

436
00:35:30 --> 00:35:32
when I set up bounds for
integration.

437
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
But, when it comes to looking
for the normal vector,

438
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
be rest assured that the normal
vector to a horizontal plane is

439
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
just vertical.
It is going to be either k or

440
00:35:44 --> 00:35:49
negative k depending on whether
I have chosen to orient it

441
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
pointing up or down.
And which one I choose might

442
00:35:54 --> 00:35:57
depend on what I am going to try
to do.

443
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
The normal vector is just
sticking straight up or straight

444
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
down.
Now, what about dS?

445
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
Well, it is just going to be
the area element in a horizontal

446
00:36:11 --> 00:36:14
plane.
It just looks like it should be

447
00:36:14 --> 00:36:16
dx dy.
I mean if I am moving on a

448
00:36:16 --> 00:36:18
horizontal plane,
to know where I am,

449
00:36:18 --> 00:36:26
I should know x and y.
So dS will be dx dy.

450
00:36:26 --> 00:36:31
If I play the game that way,
I have my vector field F.

451
00:36:31 --> 00:36:34
I do F dot n.
That just gives me the z

452
00:36:34 --> 00:36:37
component which might involve x,
y and z.

453
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
x and y I am very happy with.
They will stay as my variables.

454
00:36:40 --> 00:36:43
Whenever I see z,
well, I want to get rid of it.

455
00:36:43 --> 00:36:46
That is easy because z is just
equal to a.

456
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
I just plug that value and I am
left with only x and y,

457
00:36:50 --> 00:36:53
and I am integrating that dx
dy.

458
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
It is actually ending up being
just a usual double integral in

459
00:36:58 --> 00:37:00
x, y coordinates.
And, of course,

460
00:37:00 --> 00:37:02
once it is set up anything is
fair game.

461
00:37:02 --> 00:37:05
I might want to switch to polar
coordinates or something like

462
00:37:05 --> 00:37:09
that.
Or, I can set it up dx dy or dy

463
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
dx.
All the usual stuff applies.

464
00:37:12 --> 00:37:17
But, for the initial setup,
we are just going to use these

465
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
and express everything in terms
of x and y.

466
00:37:21 --> 00:37:27
A small variation on that.
Let's say that we take vertical

467
00:37:27 --> 00:37:35
planes that are parallel to
maybe the blackboard plane,

468
00:37:35 --> 00:37:42
so parallel to the yz plane.
That might be something like x

469
00:37:42 --> 00:37:47
equals some constant.
Well, what would I do then?

470
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
It could be pretty much the
same.

471
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
The normal vector for this guy
would be sticking straight out

472
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
towards me or away from me.
Let's say I am having it come

473
00:37:59 --> 00:38:03
to the front.
The normal vector would be

474
00:38:03 --> 00:38:07
plus/minus i.
And the variables that I would

475
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
be using, to find out my
position on this guy,

476
00:38:11 --> 00:38:14
would be y and z.
In terms of those,

477
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
the surface element is just dy
dz.

478
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
Similarly for planes parallel
to the xz plane.

479
00:38:25 --> 00:38:33
You can figure that one out.
These are somehow the easiest

480
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
ones, because those we already
know how to compute without too

481
00:38:39 --> 00:38:41
much trouble.
What if it is a more

482
00:38:41 --> 00:38:43
complicated plane?
We will come back to that next

483
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
time.
Let's explore some other

484
00:38:49 --> 00:38:56
situations first.
Number one on the list.

485
00:38:56 --> 00:39:03
Let's say that I gave you a
sphere of radius a centered at

486
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
the origin, or maybe just half
of that sphere or some portion

487
00:39:09 --> 00:39:12
of it.
Well, we have already seen how

488
00:39:12 --> 00:39:15
to do things.
Namely, we will be saying the

489
00:39:15 --> 00:39:18
normal vector is x,
y, z over a,

490
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
plus or minus depending on
whether we want it pointing in

491
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
or out.
And dS will be a^2 sin phi d

492
00:39:29 --> 00:39:32
phi d theta.
In fact, we will express

493
00:39:32 --> 00:39:35
everything in terms of phi and
theta.

494
00:39:35 --> 00:39:37
If I wanted to I could tell you
what the formulas are for x,

495
00:39:37 --> 00:39:40
y, z in terms of phi and theta.
You know them.

496
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
But it is actually better to
wait a little bit.

497
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
It is better to do F dot n,
because F is also going to have

498
00:39:48 --> 00:39:49
a bunch of x's,
y's and z's.

499
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
And if there is any kind of
symmetry to the problem then you

500
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
might end up with things like
x^2 y^2 z^2 or things that have

501
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
more symmetry that are easier to
express in terms of phi and

502
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
theta.
The advice would be first do

503
00:40:05 --> 00:40:10
the dot product with F,
and then see what you get and

504
00:40:10 --> 00:40:17
then turn it into phi and theta.
That is one we have seen.

505
00:40:17 --> 00:40:20
Let's say that I have -- It is
a close cousin.

506
00:40:20 --> 00:40:30
Let's say I have a cylinder of
radius a centered on the z-axis.

507
00:40:30 --> 00:40:37
What does that look like?
And, again, when I say

508
00:40:37 --> 00:40:40
cylinder, it could be a piece of
cylinder.

509
00:40:40 --> 00:40:44
First of all,
what does the normal vector to

510
00:40:44 --> 00:40:47
a cylinder look like?
Well, it is sticking straight

511
00:40:47 --> 00:40:50
out, but sticking straight out
in a slightly different way from

512
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
what happens with a sphere.
See, the sides of a cylinder

513
00:40:52 --> 00:40:54
are vertical.
If you imagine that you have

514
00:40:54 --> 00:40:56
this big cylindrical type in
front of you,

515
00:40:56 --> 00:40:59
hopefully you can see that a
normal vector is going to always

516
00:40:59 --> 00:41:02
be horizontal.
It is sticking straight out in

517
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
the horizontal directions.
It doesn't have any z component.

518
00:41:07 --> 00:41:13
I claim the normal vector for
the cylinder,

519
00:41:13 --> 00:41:21
if you have a point here at (x,
y, z), it would be pointing

520
00:41:21 --> 00:41:27
straight out away from the
central axis.

521
00:41:27 --> 00:41:31
My normal vector,
well, if I am taking it two

522
00:41:31 --> 00:41:34
points outwards,
will be going straight away

523
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
from the central axis.
If I look at it from above, 

524
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
maybe it is easier if I look at
it from above,

525
00:41:42 --> 00:41:45
look at x, y, 
then my cylinder looks like a

526
00:41:45 --> 00:41:49
circle and the normal vector
just points straight out.

527
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
It is the same situation as
when we had a circle in the 2D

528
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
case.
The normal vector for that is

529
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
just going to be x,
y and 0 in the z component.

530
00:42:02 --> 00:42:05
Well, plus/minus,
depending on whether you want

531
00:42:05 --> 00:42:06
it sticking in or out.

532
00:42:06 --> 00:42:41

533
00:42:41 --> 00:42:47
We said in our cylinder normal
vector is plus or minus x,

534
00:42:47 --> 00:42:54
y, zero over a.
What about the surface element?

535
00:42:54 --> 00:42:57
Before we ask that,
maybe we should first figure

536
00:42:57 --> 00:43:00
out what coordinates are we
going to use to locate ourselves

537
00:43:00 --> 00:43:02
in a cylinder.
Well, yes, 

538
00:43:02 --> 00:43:05
we probably want to use part of
a cylindrical coordinate,

539
00:43:05 --> 00:43:08
except for, 
well, we don't want r because r

540
00:43:08 --> 00:43:11
doesn't change,
it is not a variable here.

541
00:43:11 --> 00:43:15
Indeed, you probably want to
use z to tell how high you are

542
00:43:15 --> 00:43:18
and theta to tell you where you
are around.

543
00:43:18 --> 00:43:27
dS should be in terms of dz d
theta.

544
00:43:27 --> 00:43:33
Now, what is the constant?
Well, let's look at a small

545
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
piece of our cylinder
corresponding to a small angle

546
00:43:39 --> 00:43:44
delta theta and a small height
delta z.

547
00:43:44 --> 00:43:47
Well, the height,
as I said, is going to be delta

548
00:43:47 --> 00:43:50
z.
What about the width?

549
00:43:50 --> 00:43:55
It is going to be a piece of a
circle of radius a corresponding

550
00:43:55 --> 00:43:59
to the angle delta theta,
so this side will be a delta

551
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
theta.
Delta S is a delta theta delta

552
00:44:05 --> 00:44:08
z.
DS is just a dz d theta or d

553
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
theta dz.
It doesn't matter which way you

554
00:44:13 --> 00:44:16
do it.
And so when we set up the flux

555
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
integral, we will take first the
dot product of f with this

556
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
normal vector.
Then we will stick in this dS.

557
00:44:25 --> 00:44:28
And then, of course,
we will get rid of any x and y

558
00:44:28 --> 00:44:31
that are left by expressing them
in terms of theta.

559
00:44:31 --> 00:44:37
Maybe x becomes a cos theta,
y becomes a sin theta.

560
00:44:37 --> 00:44:41
These various formulas,
you should try to remember them

561
00:44:41 --> 00:44:45
because they are really useful,
for the sphere,

562
00:44:45 --> 00:44:48
for the cylinder.
And, hopefully,

563
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
those for the planes you kind
of know already intuitively.

564
00:44:52 --> 00:44:59
What about marginals or faces?
Not everything in life is made

565
00:44:59 --> 00:45:08
out of cylinders and spheres.
I mean it is a good try.

566
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
Let's look at a marginal kind
of surface.

567
00:45:11 --> 00:45:19
Let's say I give you a graph of
a function z equals f of x,

568
00:45:19 --> 00:45:21
y.
This guy has nothing to do with

569
00:45:21 --> 00:45:22
the integrand.
It is not what we are

570
00:45:22 --> 00:45:24
integrating.
We are just integrating a

571
00:45:24 --> 00:45:26
vector field that has nothing to
do with that.

572
00:45:26 --> 00:45:31
This is how I want to describe
the surface on which I will be

573
00:45:31 --> 00:45:37
integrating.
My surface is given by z as a

574
00:45:37 --> 00:45:40
function of x,
y.

575
00:45:40 --> 00:45:48
Well, I would need to tell you
what n is and what dS is.

576
00:45:48 --> 00:45:51
That is going to be slightly
annoying.

577
00:45:51 --> 00:45:54
I mean, I don't want to tell
them separately because you see

578
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58
they are pretty hard.
Instead, I am going to tell you

579
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
that in this case,
well, let's see.

580
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
What variables do we want?
I am going to tell you a

581
00:46:07 --> 00:46:11
formula for n dS.
What variables do we want to

582
00:46:11 --> 00:46:15
express this in terms of?
Well, most likely x and y

583
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
because we know how to express z
in terms of x and y.

584
00:46:19 --> 00:46:26
This is an invitation to get
rid of any z that might be left

585
00:46:26 --> 00:46:30
and set everything up in terms
of dx dy.

586
00:46:30 --> 00:46:31
The formula that we are going
to see,

587
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
I think we are going to see the
details of why it works

588
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
tomorrow,
is that you can take negative

589
00:46:40 --> 00:46:44
partial f partial x,
negative partial f partial y, 

590
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
one, 
dx dy.

591
00:46:48 --> 00:46:52
Plus/minus depending on which
way you want it to go.

592
00:46:52 --> 00:46:57
If you really want to know what
dS is, well, dS is the magnitude

593
00:46:57 --> 00:47:01
of this vector times dx dy.
There will be a square root and

594
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
some squares and some stuff.
What is the normal vector?

595
00:47:04 --> 00:47:10
Well, you take this vector and
you scale it down to unit

596
00:47:10 --> 00:47:14
length.
Just to emphasize it,

597
00:47:14 --> 00:47:24
this guy here is not n and this
guy here is not dS.

598
00:47:24 --> 00:47:27
Each of them is more
complicated than that,

599
00:47:27 --> 00:47:31
but the combination somehow
simplifies nicely.

600
00:47:31 --> 00:47:36
And that is good news for us.
Now, concretely,

601
00:47:36 --> 00:47:40
one way you can think about it
is this tells you how to reduce

602
00:47:40 --> 00:47:42
things to an integral of x and
y.

603
00:47:42 --> 00:47:44
And, of course,
you will have to figure out

604
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
what are the bounds on x and y.
That means you will need to

605
00:47:47 --> 00:47:51
know what does the shadow of
your surface look like in the x,

606
00:47:51 --> 00:47:59
y plane.
To set up bounds on whatever

607
00:47:59 --> 00:48:06
you will get dx dy,
well, of course you can switch

608
00:48:06 --> 00:48:08
to dy dx or anything you would
like,

609
00:48:08 --> 00:48:19
but you will need to look at
the shadow of S in the x y

610
00:48:19 --> 00:48:22
plane.
But only do that after you

611
00:48:22 --> 00:48:27
gotten rid of all the z.
When you no longer have z then

612
00:48:27 --> 00:48:33
you can figure out what the
bounds are for x and y.

613
00:48:33 --> 00:48:40
Any questions about that?
Yes?

614
00:48:40 --> 00:48:42
For the cylinder.
OK.

615
00:48:42 --> 00:48:44
Let me re-explain quickly how I
got a normal vector for the

616
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
cylinder.
If you know what a cylinder

617
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
looks like, you probably can see
that the normal vector sticks

618
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
straight out of it horizontally.
That means the z component of n

619
00:48:56 --> 00:48:59
is going to be zero.
And then the x,

620
00:48:59 --> 00:49:02
y components you get by looking
at it from above.

621
00:49:02 --> 00:49:12
One last thing I want to say.
What about the geometric

622
00:49:12 --> 00:49:15
interpretation and how to prove
it?

623
00:49:15 --> 00:49:27
Well, if your vector field F is
a velocity field then the flux

624
00:49:27 --> 00:49:37
is the amount of matter that
crosses the surface that passes

625
00:49:37 --> 00:49:44
through S per unit time.
And the way that you would

626
00:49:44 --> 00:49:47
prove it would be similar to the
picture that I drew when we did

627
00:49:47 --> 00:49:50
it in the plane.
Namely, you would consider a

628
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
small element of a surface delta
S.

629
00:49:53 --> 00:49:55
And you would try to figure out
what is the stuff that flows

630
00:49:55 --> 00:49:59
through it in a second.
Well, it is the stuff that

631
00:49:59 --> 00:50:05
lives in a small box whose base
is that piece of surface and

632
00:50:05 --> 00:50:10
whose other side is given by the
vector field.

633
00:50:10 --> 00:50:15
And then the volume of that is
given by base times height,

634
00:50:15 --> 00:50:20
and the height is F dot n.
It is the same argument as what

635
00:50:20 --> 00:50:22
we saw in the plane.
OK.

636
00:50:22 --> 00:50:24
Next time we will see more
formulas.

637
00:50:24 --> 00:50:28
We will first see how to prove
this, more ways to do it,

638
00:50:28 --> 00:50:31
more examples.
And then we will get to the

639
00:50:31 --> 00:50:34
divergence theorem.
 

640
00:50:34 --> 00:50:39
