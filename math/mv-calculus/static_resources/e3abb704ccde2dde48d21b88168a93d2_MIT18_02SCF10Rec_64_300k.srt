CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,050
In this video, I'd like
us to consider

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,580
the following problem.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,270
The first part is I'd like to
know for what values of b is

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,700
this vector field
F conservative.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,520
And F is defined as y i plus
the quantity x plus byz j,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,930
plus the quantity y
squared plus 1, k.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,270
So as you can see, the only
thing we're allowed to

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,800
manipulate in this problem is b.
b will be some real number.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,390
And I want to know what real
numbers can I put in for b so

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,890
that this vector field
is conservative.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,480
The second part of this problem
is for each b-value

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,680
you determined from one, find
a potential function.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,200
So fix the b-value for one of
the ones that is acceptable,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,990
based on number one, and then
find the potential function.

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,420
And then the third part says
that you should explain why F

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,530
dot dr is exact, and this is
obviously for the b values

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,990
determined from one.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,940
So the second and third
part are once

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,100
you know the b-values.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,330
And you're only going to use
those b-values that make F

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,970
conservative, because that's
the place where we can talk

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,670
about finding a potential
function, and where we can

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,650
talk about F dot dr
being exact are

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,560
exactly those values.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,250
OK.

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,650
So why don't you pause the
video, work on these three

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,270
problems, and then when you're
feeling good about them, bring

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,720
the video back up and I'll
show you what I did.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:36,300

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,560
OK, welcome back.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,530
Again, we're interested in doing
three things with this

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,210
vector field.

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,960
The first thing we want to do
is to find the values of b

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,880
that make this vector
field conservative.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,920
So I will start with
that part.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,270
And as we know from the
lecture, the thing I

39
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,470
ultimately need to do is I need
to find the curl of F.

40
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,390
OK, so the curl of F is going
to measure how far F is from

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,190
being conservative.

42
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,580
So if the curl of F is 0, I'm
going to have F being

43
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,190
conservative.

44
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,560
So that's really what I'm
interested in doing first.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,320
So I'm actually just going to
rewrite what the curl of F

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,570
actually is.

47
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,985
So I'm going to let F--

48
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm going to denote in our
usual way by P, Q, R--

49
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:26,710
in this case, be specifically
y comma x plus byz comma y

50
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,600
squared plus 1.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,940
OK, that's my P, Q, R. So P is
y, Q is x plus byz, and R is y

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,160
squared plus 1.

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,460
And now the curl of F--

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,250

55
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,560
which was found in the lecture,
so I'm not going to

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,710
show you again how to find it,
I'm just going to write the

57
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,880
formula for it-- is exactly
the following vector.

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,220
It's the derivative of the R
component with respect to y,

59
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,490
minus the Q component
with respect to z.

60
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,610
That's the i-value.

61
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:08,650
The j-value is P sub
z minus R sub x, j.

62
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,990
The k-value is Q sub
x minus P sub y, k.

63
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,930
OK, so there are three
components here.

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,520
And let's just start figuring
out with these values are, and

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,090
then we'll see what kind of
restrictions we have on b.

66
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,940
So let's start doing this.

67
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,900
So again, this is P, this is Q,
and this is R. So R sub y

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,390
is the derivative of this
component with respect to y.

69
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,230
That's just 2y.

70
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,320
Q sub z is the derivative of
this with respect to z.

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,030
Well, this is 0,
and this is by.

72
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,560

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,190
OK.

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,660
Let's look at the rest first.
P sub z: the derivative of

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,535
this with respect to z is 0.

76
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:56,782
The derivative of R with
respect to x is 0.

77
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:59,720
So that doesn't have any
b's in it at all.

78
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,580
And then Q sub x
minus P sub y.

79
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,440
Q is the middle one.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,970
Q sub x is 1.

81
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,240

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,050
P is the first one.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,300
P sub y is 1.

84
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,130

85
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,135
OK, so what do we get here?

86
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:16,000
I should have written
equals there, maybe.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,970
OK, so the j component is 0.

88
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,910
And the k component is 0.

89
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,140
So all I'm left with
is 2y minus by, i.

90
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,590
And if I want F to be
conservative, this quantity

91
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,360
has to be 0, so I see there's
only one b-value that's going

92
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,420
to work, and that is
b is equal to 2.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,190

94
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,820
OK?

95
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,280
So I know in part one, the
answer to the question is just

96
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
for b equals 2 is
F conservative.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
That was, maybe,
poorly phrased.

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,830
F is conservative only
when b is 2.

99
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,080
OK.

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,960
And that's because the curl of
F is 0 only when b is 2.

101
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,310
All right.

102
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,300
So now we can move on
to the second part.

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,230
And the second part is for this
particular value of b,

104
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,980
find a potential function.

105
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,500
And our strategy for that is
going to be one of the methods

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,720
from lecture.

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,370
And it's going to be the method
from lecture that in

108
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,820
three dimensions is much
easier than the other.

109
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,240
So the one method in lecture
that's easy in three

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
dimensions is where you start
at the origin, and you

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,680
integrate F dot dr along
a curve that's

112
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,950
made up of line segments.

113
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,290
So this strategy I've done
before in two dimensions in

114
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,170
one of the problems
in recitation.

115
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,070
Now, we'll see it in
three dimensions.

116
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,360
So what we're going to do is
we're going to integrate along

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,240
a certain curve F dot dr. And
this curve is going to go from

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,500
the origin to (x1, y1, z1).

119
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:50,210
And that will give us
f of (x1, y1, z1).

120
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,450
OK.

121
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,360
So this is a sort of general
strategy, and now we'll talk

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
about it specifically.

123
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,090
This will actually be f of (x1,
y1, z1) plus a constant,

124
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,470
but we'll deal with that
part right at the end.

125
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,400
OK, so C in this case is going
to be made up of three curves.

126
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,630
And I'm going to draw them in a
picture and then we're going

127
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,720
to describe them.

128
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,380
So I'm going to start
at (0, 0, 0).

129
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,700
My first curve will go out to
x1 comma 0, 0, and that's

130
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,280
going to be the curve C1.

131
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,060
Oops.

132
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,560
I want that to go
the other way.

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,590
That way.

134
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,300
OK, C1 is going to go from the
origin to x1 comma 0, 0.

135
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,920
So the y- and z-values are going
to be 0 and 0 all the

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,050
way along, and the x-value
is going to change.

137
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,660
My next one--

138
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,190
I'm going to make it
long so I can have

139
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,550
enough room to write--

140
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,900
that's going to be my C2.

141
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:49,180
And that's going to be
x1 comma y1 comma 0.

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,020
So in the end, what I've done is
I've taken my x-value, I've

143
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
kept it fixed all the way along
here, but I'm varying

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,210
the y-value out to y1.

145
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,730
And then the last one is going
to go straight up.

146
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,920
Right there.

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,500
And so it's going to be with the
x-value and y-value fixed.

148
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,020
And at the end, I will
be at x1, y1, z1.

149
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,270
And this is C3.

150
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,230

151
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,590
And this one, I'm going to
move in this direction.

152
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,000
Those are my three curves.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,550
And I want to point out that in
order to understand how to

154
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,540
simplify this problem, I'm going
to have to remind myself

155
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,210
what F dot dr is.

156
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,530
OK.

157
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:37,310
So F dot dr is P dx plus
Q dy plus R dz.

158
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,120
Right?

159
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,550
That's what F dot dr is.

160
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,110
And so what I'm interested in,
I'm going to integrate each of

161
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,630
these things along C1, C2, C3.

162
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,280
But let's notice what happens
along certain

163
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,500
numbers of these curves.

164
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,660
If we come back over here.

165
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,220
On C1, y is fixed
and z as fixed.

166
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,630
So dy and dz are both 0.

167
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,740
So on C1, I only have to
integrate P. OK, so I'm going

168
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,240
to keep track of that.

169
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,340
On C1, which C1 is parametrized
by x--

170
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,860
0 to x--

171
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,380
I only need to worry about
the P. P of x, 0, 0, dx.

172
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,200
This is my C1 component, and
there's nothing else there,

173
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,890
because these two are both 0.

174
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,180
Right?

175
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,470
Now let's consider what
happens on C2.

176
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,930
If I look here.

177
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,810
On C2, the x-value is fixed and
the z-value is fixed. x is

178
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,340
fixed at x1 and z
is fixed at 0.

179
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,080
And so dx and dz are
both 0, because x

180
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,190
and z are not changing.

181
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,560
So there's only a
dy component.

182
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,810
So on C2, which is parametrized
in y--

183
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,120
from 0 to y1--

184
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,300
I'm only interested in Q at
x1 comma y comma 0, dy.

185
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,730
Again, this component is 0
on C2 because dx is 0.

186
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,770
And this component is 0
on C2 because dz is 0.

187
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,900
And this component--

188
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm evaluating it--

189
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,640
x is fixed at x1, z is fixed
at 0, and the y is varying

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,070
from 0 to y1.

191
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,360
And then there's one more
component, and I'm going to

192
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,250
write it below, and then we'll
do the rest over here.

193
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,850
And the third component
is the C3 component.

194
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,540
Now, not surprisingly--

195
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,200
if I come back over here--

196
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,380
because x and y are fixed all
along the C3 component, the

197
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,130
only thing that's
changing is z.

198
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,050
So dx and dy are 0, so
I'm only worried

199
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,610
about the dz part.

200
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,840
OK.

201
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,910
So again, as happened before, I
only had P in the first one

202
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,940
and Q in the second one,
and now I have R only

203
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,000
in the third one.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,840
And it's parametrized
in z, from 0 to z1.

205
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,730
That's what z varies over.

206
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,830
And it's going to be R at
x1 comma y1 comma z dz.

207
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,580
Because the x's are fixed at x1,
the y is fixed at y1, but

208
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,415
z is varying from 0 to z1.

209
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,020
All right.

210
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,800
So I have these three parts,
and now I just have to fill

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,750
them in with the vector field
that I have. I want to find

212
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,090
what P is at (x, 0, 0), what Q
is at (x1, y1, 0), and what R

213
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,870
is at (x1, y1, z).

214
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,080
And then integrate.

215
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,360
So I have two steps left.

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,770
One is plugging in and
one is evaluating.

217
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,940
So let me remind us what P, Q,
and R actually are, and then

218
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,950
we'll see what we get.

219
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,260
Let me write it again.

220
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,630
Maybe here.

221
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:31,870
P, Q, R was equal to y
comma x plus 2yz--

222
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,860
I'll put it here so you don't
have to look and I don't have

223
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,410
to look-- and then
y squared plus 1.

224
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,270
OK.

225
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,380
So P at x comma 0 comma 0.

226
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,450
Well, if I plug in
0 for y, P is 0.

227
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,160
So P at (x, 0, 0)
is equal to 0.

228
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,250
So I get nothing to integrate
in the first part.

229
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,340
That's nice.

230
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,040
OK.

231
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,320
Now, what is Q at x1
comma y comma 0?

232
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, that would
be an x1 here.

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,550
0 for y makes this
term go away.

234
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,130
So it's just equal to x1.

235
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,930
Right?

236
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:18,660
And then R at x1 comma y1 comma
z is y1 squared plus 1.

237
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,480

238
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,790
So now I'm going to substitute
these in to what I'm

239
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,170
integrating.

240
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,192
So in the first one, there's
nothing there.

241
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,820
Let me just write
it right here.

242
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,375
The Q is going to be
the integral from

243
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,150
0 to y1 of x1 dy.

244
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,610
And the R part is going to be
the integral from 0 to z1 of

245
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,090
y1 squared plus 1 dz.

246
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,060
OK, so the P part
was disappeared.

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,850
This is the Q part
evaluated where I

248
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,580
needed it to be evaluated.

249
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,310
It's just x1 dy.

250
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,030
And the R part evaluated at
(x1, y1, z) is just y1

251
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,130
squared plus 1.

252
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,500
And so I integrate that in z.

253
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,990
So if I integrate this in
y, all I get is x1 y

254
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,720
evaluated 0 and y1.

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,070
So here I just get an x1 y1.

256
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,510
Right?

257
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,800
And then here, if I integrate
this in z, I just get a z--

258
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
and so I evaluate that
at z1 and 0--

259
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,890
I just get z1 times
y1 squared plus 1.

260
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,400
OK.

261
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,330
So this is actually my
potential function.

262
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,190
And so let me write
it formally.

263
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,890
I should actually say, this
is my final answer.

264
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,760
Right?

265
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,920
I was integrating.

266
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,730
This is actually what I get.

267
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,720
And so what I was trying to
find-- if you remember.

268
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,190
I'm going to come back here
and just mention it again.

269
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,550
What I was doing was I was
integrating along a curve, F

270
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,210
dot dr, to give me f
of (x1, y1, z1).

271
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,010
Right?

272
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,530
So now I've found it.

273
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,940
The only thing I said is we also
have to allow for there

274
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,170
to be a constant.

275
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,440
OK.

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
So the potential function is
actually exactly this function

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,990
plus a constant.

278
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,950
OK.

279
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,310
So this is f of (x1, y1, z1).

280
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,160
And since I don't have
much room above, I'll

281
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,410
just write it below.

282
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,330

283
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,730
So that's my potential function
for this vector

284
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,920
field, capital F, when
it is conservative.

285
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,290
So when b is equal to 2.

286
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,770
OK, and there was one last
part to this question.

287
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:17,970
Right?

288
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,180
So if we come all the
way back over, we're

289
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,790
reminded of one last part.

290
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,160
It was explain why F dot dr
is exact for the b values

291
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,790
determined from number one.

292
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,080
And the reason is exactly
because of

293
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,410
the following thing.

294
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,360
F is conservative based on
the fact that b is 2.

295
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,530
And so when we talk about when
F dot dr is exact, the

296
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,960
simplest case is capital F is
conservative, and I'm on a

297
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,810
simply connected domain.

298
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,440
OK.

299
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,250
And if you notice, capital F is
defined for all values x,

300
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,900
y, z, and is differentiable
for all values x, y, z.

301
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,370
So F is defined and
differentiable

302
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,550
everywhere on R3.

303
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,040
R3 is simply connected.

304
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,610
So we have a conservative
vector field on a simply

305
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,650
connected region.

306
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,700
And that's what it means.

307
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,100
That's one way that we have of
knowing F dot dr is exact.

308
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,060
And so that actually
answers the

309
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,910
third part of the question.

310
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,010
So again, let me just remind
you what we did.

311
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,420
We started with a vector field
F, we found values for b that

312
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,310
made that vector field
conservative, and then we used

313
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,090
one of the techniques in class
to find a potential function

314
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,950
for that value of b.

315
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,580
So there were a number of
steps involved, but

316
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,420
ultimately, again, it's the same
type of problem you've

317
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,710
seen before when F was
a vector field in two

318
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,750
dimensions.

319
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,250
So it shouldn't be feeling too
different from some of the

320
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,120
stuff you saw earlier.

321
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,520
OK, I think that's
where I'll stop.

322
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,624
