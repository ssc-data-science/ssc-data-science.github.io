JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.260
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.200
In lecture, among other things,
you've been learning

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.780
about computing components of
one vector in the direction of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.390
another vector.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.230
So I have a straightforward
problem about

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.090
that for you here.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.730
So we've got two vectors.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170
The vector 2i minus 2j plus k.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.080
And we've got the vector
i plus j plus k.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.610
And so what I'd like you to do
for me is to compute the

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.740
component of this first vector
in the direction

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.090
of the second vector.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.040
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.130
that out, come back, and we
can work on it together.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.320
Welcome back.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.610
So hopefully you had some
luck with this problem.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290
Now this problem is pretty
straightforward.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.680
Really all you have to do is
remember what the definition

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.360
of component is.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.220
And after that, it's
smooth sailing.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.280
So in particular, the component
of one vector in the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.870
direction of another is the
length of what you get when

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.610
you project this vector
onto that one, well,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.640
plus a sign, right?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.850
So if the projection is in the
same direction, then it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.680
positive, or if it's
in the opposite

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000
direction, it's negative.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.490
So let me draw a picture
of what I mean by that.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.080
So if you have a vector V and
you have another vector W,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.642
then the projection of V onto W
is what you get if you make

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:43.370
a, drop a perpendicular line
there, and then it's just this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.060
vector here.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.750
So that's the projection.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.930
And then the component is the
length of that projection.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.620
Again, with the sign
if necessary.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.480
And so we can see since this
is going to be a right

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.470
triangle here, we can see that
this vector has length that's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:08.730
just given by the length of V.
So the length-- rather-- the

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:20.860
component of V in direction
W is, so it's just the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.890
length of V, right.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.480
That's the length of
the hypotenuse--

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.100
times the cosine of the
angle between them--

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.460
so it's times cosine of theta.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.120
Now this length of V times
cosine theta, this should

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.400
remind you of something.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.490
This looks very much like this
formula we had for the dot

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.400
product, right?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.240
So another way of writing this
is to say that this is equal

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.710
to V dot W.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.250
So V dot W is the length of V
times the length of W times

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.470
the cosine of the angle.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.000
And so here we just have the
length of V times the cosine

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.610
of the angle.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.070
So we have to divide this
through by the length of W. So

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.100
this is what the component is,
and this is the simple formula

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.620
for it if you're given V and
W in some easy-to-use form.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.250
And indeed in this problem,
we're given V and W just in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.840
they're nice coordinate forms.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.310
So we're given that our vector
V that we want the component

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.920
of is 2i minus 2j plus k.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.660
And the direction W that we're
looking at is i plus j plus k.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.580
So in our case, we just have to
compute these expressions V

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.120
dot W and the length of W in
order to put them into this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.680
formula, and then
we'll be done.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:47.270
So in our case, V dot W-- well,
that's straightforward

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.920
because we're given V and
W in coordinates--

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.650
so this is just 2 times
1 plus minus 2 times 1

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.710
plus 1 times 1.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.460
So that's, OK, 2 minus
2 plus 1 is 1.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.690
And the length of W-- well, you
know, it's just your usual

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.836
length formula--

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:13.040
is 1 squared plus 1 squared
plus 1 squared, the whole

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.460
thing is square rooted,
which is equal to the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.260
square root of 3.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.570
So we've got V dot W and we have
the length of W, and so

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.720
then we just need to put them
right into this formula.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.370
That the component of V in the
direction of W is given by

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.620
this expression.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.100
So the component of--

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.913
I'm not going to write it out
with i's, j's, and k's, I'm

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:40.650
going to write--

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.535
2, minus 2, 1.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:55.060
And direction 1, 1, 1 is, well
we just have to divide the dot

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.520
product by the length of
the direction vector.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.950
So that's 1 divided by
the square root of 3.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.300
So that's that, I'll
end there.
