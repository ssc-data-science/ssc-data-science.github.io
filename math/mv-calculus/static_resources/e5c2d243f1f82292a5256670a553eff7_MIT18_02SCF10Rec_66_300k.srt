JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,750
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,870
In lecture, you've been
learning about Stokes'

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,410
Theorem, and I have a nice
exercise on Stokes' Theorem

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,320
for you here.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,730
So I'm going to let F be
this field that I've

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,270
written just above me.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,600
So it's 2xz minus 2y comma 2yz
plus 2x comma x squared plus y

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,390
squared plus z squared.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,080
And I've got C.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,640
So C is this

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,380
complicated-looking curve here.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,320
So it sort of dips up and
down and back around.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,630
But the thing I'm really going
to tell you about it is it all

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:49,020
lies on this cylinder
of radius b.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,290
So C is this curve in the
cylinder of radius b that

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,010
wraps around it once, but
behaves oddly while it's

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,090
wrapping around.

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,660
So what I'd like you to do is
I'd like you to use Stokes'

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,210
Theorem to compute the integral
around this curve of

22
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,910
F dot dr. Now, my hint to you
is that for Stokes' Theorem,

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,520
you can use-- just like you have
for Green's Theorem and

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,820
for divergence Theorem that
we've talked about before--

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,330
you have these extended versions
that let you consider

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,000
more than one boundary piece.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,300
So the same thing works
for Stokes' Theorem.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,590
So Stokes' Theorem works
perfectly well when you have a

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,170
piece of a surface with more
than one boundary curve,

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,170
provided you orient everything
correctly.

31
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,530
So you might think about how you
can use Stokes' Theorem to

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,940
replace this complicated curve
with a surface integral and an

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,780
easier to understand curve.

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,450
And if you can do that, then
computing the other two gives

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,260
you the third one.

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,050
All right.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,120
So that's my hint to you for
computing this integral.

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,140
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at that, come

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,490
back, and we can work
on it together.

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:01,020

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,600
Hopefully, you had some luck
working on this problem.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's talk about it.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,460
So before I left, I gave you
this hint that maybe the thing

44
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,030
to do here isn't to try and
parametrize this curve

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,270
directly and compute the line
integral directly since it's a

46
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,870
complicated-looking curve, and
also since I haven't really

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,340
given you enough information
to do that, and instead to

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,540
think about applying
Stokes' Theorem.

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,410
So to think about applying
Stokes' Theorem, what we'd

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,930
like is a nice surface,
and with this curve

51
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,570
as part of its boundary.

52
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,830
Well, what is such a surface?

53
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,950
Well, this curve lies all on
the cylinder of radius b.

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,220
So a natural choice for a
surface is to use some piece

55
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,240
of this cylinder.

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,860
So maybe we could use the piece
of this cylinder with

57
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,760
this as its upper boundary.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,080
So then what might be a natural

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,110
lower boundary to choose?

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,540
Well, we just want to choose
something nice and simple.

61
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,920
Right?

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,340
So, what's nice and simple?

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,490
Well, maybe we can choose this
bottom circle that's in the

64
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,060
plane y equals x.

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,300
All right.

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,550
So I'm going to call
that circle C1.

67
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,200
So that's the circle of radius
b in the xy plane.

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,615
Sorry, not the plane
y equals x.

69
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:09,730
The xy plane.

70
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,730
The plane z equals 0.

71
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,740
So we've got the top curve
C and we've got this

72
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,460
bottom curve C1.

73
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,840
Now, the way I've oriented them,
I've oriented them both

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,180
so that they're going
counterclockwise as you look

75
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,030
down from the z-axis.

76
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,010
So in that case, what does
Stokes' Theorem say?

77
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,680
Well, Stokes' Theorem says that
the integral over the

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,620
piece of the surface between
them-- let's call it S of curl

79
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,520
F dot n with respect
to surface area--

80
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,460
is equal to--

81
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,190
OK.

82
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,720
So let's say we can give it the
outward pointing normal.

83
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,280
In which case, C1 will be
positively oriented and C will

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,330
be negatively oriented.

85
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:08,110
So this is equal to the line
integral over C1 of F dot dr

86
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:15,660
minus the line integral
over C of F dot dr.

87
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,730
And so what's nice about this
formula is that it replaces

88
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,340
computing the integral
that we want.

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,650
Instead of computing that, we
can try and compute this other

90
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,770
line integral and this
surface integral.

91
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,550
And if these are easier to
compute, then computing the

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,340
two of them gives us what the
value of this is just by

93
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,390
subtracting, or by adding
and subtracting, or

94
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,610
by arithmetic, right?

95
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,640
So if these integrals are easy
to compute, then that makes

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,570
this one easy without actually
having to parametrize and

97
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,490
compute it.

98
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,430
So let's take a look at what
these integrals are.

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,410
Let's do the surface integral
first since it's on the left.

100
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,680
So in order to compute the
surface integral, we're going

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
to need to compute the

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,850
curl of F. So OK.

103
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,590
So F is this kind of messy
looking thing here.

104
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,660
So for curl of F, what
have we got?

105
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,410
So it's going to be big
thing times i hat.

106
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,890
So it's going to be i hat times
this determinant, right?

107
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,790
So let me write the
determinant.

108
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,700
So on top we've got i hat j hat
k hat, then we have the

109
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,050
partial x partial y partial
z, and then we have the

110
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,640
components.

111
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:42,580
So these are 2xz minus 2y, and
2yz plus 2x, and x squared

112
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,330
plus y squared plus z squared.

113
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,750
All right.

114
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,075
So that's i hat, j
hat, and k hat.

115
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:57,510
And then we've got partial over
partial x, partial over

116
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,360
partial y, and partial
over partial z.

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,850
So this is what the curl
is, and so now we have

118
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,860
to expand this out.

119
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,426
So for i, it's going to be
partial y of x squared plus y

120
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,630
squared plus z squared.

121
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,880
So that's 2y--

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,890

123
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,760
minus partial z of 2yz
plus 2x, so that's--

124
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,860
minus 2y, i hat.

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,680
Plus--

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,780
for j hat, it's going to
be partial z of 2xz

127
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,690
minus 2y, so that's--

128
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,880
2x--

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,780
minus partial x of x squared
plus y squared plus z squared,

130
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,500
so that's-- minus 2x, j hat.

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,950
Plus--

132
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,040
for k hat, we want partial x
of 2yz plus 2x, so that's--

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,090
2--

134
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,495
minus partial y of 2xz minus 2y,
so that's minus minus 2,

135
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:07,420
so that's-- plus 2, k hat.

136
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,410
All right.

138
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,630
OK.

139
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,060
So the i-component is 0 and
the j-component is 0.

140
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,400
So this is a nice, simple one.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,540
So the curl of here.

142
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,170
The k-component is just 4.

143
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,420
So this is equal to 4k.

144
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,060

145
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,680
OK.

146
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,460
So that's what the
curl of F is.

147
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,040
Now what do we need
to compute?

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,510
We need to compute curl of F
dot the normal vector with

149
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,770
respect to surface area.

150
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,960
Now let's look at what
our surface is.

151
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Our surface is right here, and
it's this vertical cylinder.

152
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,410
Well, what is the normal vector
of a vertical cylinder?

153
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,220
Well, it's pointing straight
away from the axis.

154
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,820
Right?

155
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,070
It's perpendicular to the
surface of the cylinder, so

156
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,600
it's parallel to the xy plane.

157
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320

158
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,190
It rotates as you go around the
cylinder, but it's always

159
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,690
in the xy plane.

160
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,810
So what does that mean?

161
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,620
Well, that means in particular,
it's perpendicular

162
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,460
to things in the z-direction.

163
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,690
Right?

164
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,200
So if we look, we see our curl
here is just straight upward

165
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,550
in the z-direction.

166
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,730
And our normal vector
has no z-component.

167
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,480
It's only in the xy plane.

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,080
So this k hat is orthogonal
to n, OK?

169
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,460
So the curl and n
are orthogonal.

170
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,330
So their dot product is 0.

171
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,790
So this surface integral is
a surface integral of 0.

172
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,340
So it just gives you 0.

173
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,870
OK.

174
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,350
So great.

175
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,830
So that's really nice.

176
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,050
That simplifies our
life very much.

177
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,380
Now, our line integral
that we want.

178
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,650
We just have it in terms of this
one other line integral.

179
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:45,850
Right?

180
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,352
So the surface integral is 0.

181
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:49,400
And let me see.

182
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
Where should I put this?

183
00:08:50,500 --> 00:09:01,320
OK, the curl is 4k, so the
surface integral curl F dot n

184
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,440
ds is also equal to 0.

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,170
So having made that
simplification, now we just

186
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,280
need this line integral
over C1.

187
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,860
And that'll give us
what we need.

188
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,350
So let's have a go at that.

189
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:30,990
So C1 is the circle of radius
b centered at the origin and

190
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,840
the xy plane.

191
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,410
OK.

192
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm not going to write
that down.

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm just going to say it.

194
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,860
The circle of radius
b centered at the

195
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,520
origin and the xy plane.

196
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,010
So OK.

197
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,260
So it's not that hard
to parametrize.

198
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,850

199
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,510
So it's parametrized by x
equals b cosine theta, y

200
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,030
equals b sine theta.

201
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,210
We should check.

202
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,630
We should double-check that
we're doing the right

203
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,070
direction of parametrization.

204
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,050
Let's go have a look.

205
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,710
Let's see.

206
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes.

207
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,340
OK.

208
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,670
So we parametrized
this circle going

209
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,660
counterclockwise in the xy plane.

210
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,160
So good.

211
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,490
So this parametrization is going
the right direction.

212
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,940
Otherwise, we'd have to change
the sine theta or something.

213
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,060
So it's x is b cosine theta,
y is b sine theta.

214
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,515
And we're going once around the
circle, so we want 0 less

215
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:22,600
than or equal to theta less
than or equal to 2 pi.

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,410
And so what do we have?

217
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:33,320
So now we want to compute the
integral over the circle of F

218
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,060
dot dr. So let's see what F
looks like in this situation.

219
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,180
So let's go back
and look at the

220
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,150
expression for F over here.

221
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,740
So in this plane, we have
z is equal to 0.

222
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:59,130
So F is minus 2y, plus 2x,
x squared plus y squared.

223
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,300
OK?

224
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,600
OK, so let's come back then.

225
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,950
So F is what I just said, so
this is equal to the integral

226
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:21,470
over C of minus 2y
dx, plus 2x dy--

227
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,890
plus x squared plus y squared
dz, but we're in the plane z

228
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,490
equals 0, so dz is always
0 in that plane--

229
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,250
so we don't have a
third term there.

230
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,510
Great.

231
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,850
So this is our integral, and now
we can substitute from our

232
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,270
parametrization here.

233
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,800
So this is equal to the integral
from 0 to 2 pi.

234
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,510
So minus 2y dx.

235
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:55,810
So that's minus 2b sine
theta, times--

236
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:07,380
dx is-- minus b sine theta
d theta, plus--

237
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,720
2x, so that's--

238
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,540
2b cosine theta, times--
dy, which is--

239
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,360
b cosine theta d theta.

240
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,530

241
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,850
Whew.

242
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,050
This is quite a long
expression.

243
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,870
So our line integral around C
of F dot dr is equal to the

244
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,560
integral from 0 to 2 pi of
minus 2b sine theta times

245
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,960
minus b sine theta d theta.

246
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,230
So this is 2b squared sine
squared theta d theta.

247
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,010
And this is 2b cosine squared
theta d theta.

248
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,320
So OK.

249
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,660
So that 2b squared
is a constant.

250
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,010
We can just factor it out.

251
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,030
And we're left with sine squared
theta plus cosine

252
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,610
squared theta d theta.

253
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,380
All right.

254
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,150
OK.

255
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,370
That's great.

256
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm happy to have that.

257
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,000
Right?

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Sine squared theta plus
cosine squared theta

259
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,950
is going to be 1.

260
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,610
OK.

261
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,990
So we can rewrite this.

262
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,650
I'm going to bring
it back up here.

263
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,210
So that's equal to the integral
from 0 to 2 pi, of 2b

264
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:22,650
squared d theta, which
is 4 pi b squared.

265
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,330
Great.

266
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,480
OK, so that's our line integral
around this bottom

267
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,400
curve

268
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
C. Oh, dear.

269
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,630
I've been writing C, but this
is not our original curve C,

270
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,810
this is our new curve C1,
like I wrote there.

271
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,260
Sorry.

272
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,060
So everywhere I wrote the line
integral over C-- both of

273
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,300
these places-- it was supposed
to be a line integral over C1.

274
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,260
Sorry about that.

275
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,360
So we've got this line integral
over C1, and it

276
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,970
worked out to 4 pi b squared,
just using our usual

277
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,830
parametrize-and-compute
technique for

278
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,190
computing line integrals.

279
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,610
So OK.

280
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,020
So now, let's see
where we're at.

281
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,050
Let's go back over here to when
we wrote down what the

282
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,270
extended Stokes' Theorem
says in our case.

283
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,350
So Stokes' Theorem told us
that the thing we were

284
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,790
interested in-- this
is the thing we're

285
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,160
trying to compute, right?

286
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,520
The problem asked us to compute
the line integral over

287
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,410
C of F dot dr. Well, extended
Stokes' Theorem said in order

288
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,810
to compute this line integral,
what you can do is you can

289
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,110
compute this surface integral
over S, and you can compute

290
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,740
this line integral over this
other curve C1, and then these

291
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,970
three things have to satisfy
this relationship.

292
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,780
That's what's Stokes'
Theorem says.

293
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,080
And now we've computed.

294
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,390
We've computed the surface
integral, and we found it was

295
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,140
equal to 0 by a simple geometric
argument that didn't

296
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,560
require us to actually compute
a surface integral.

297
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,290
And we computed this line
integral just now by

298
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,790
parametrizing and computing it.

299
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,260
So OK.

300
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,020
So this was 0 and this
was 4 pi b squared.

301
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,690
So if we just add our integral
in question to the other side,

302
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,510
what we find--

303
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,020
I'm going to go find
some empty board

304
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,360
space to write it down--

305
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:21,210
so our integral over C of F dot
dr is equal to this other

306
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,285
line integral minus the
surface integral.

307
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:27,930
So it's equal to 4 pi
b squared minus 0.

308
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,280
Just rearranging that equation
we were looking at a second

309
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,550
ago from Stokes' Theorem.

310
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,390
So it's just 4 pi b squared.

311
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,910
So that's the answer,
and I'll end there.

312
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,740
