2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,670
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,380
In this video what
I'd like you to do

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,660
is work on proving
the following product

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,970
rule for the del operator.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,870
So we're going to let
capital F be a vector field

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,940
and u be a scalar function.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,030
And we want to show the
product rule for the del

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,620
operator which--
it's in quotes but it

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,510
should remind you of the product
rule we have for functions.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,690
And it is that del dot
the quantity u times

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,490
F-- so u is the scalar function
and F is the vector field-- is

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:43,310
actually equal to the gradient
of u dotted with F plus u

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,510
times del dot F. Where F
again is the vector field.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,375
So why don't you take a
moment to prove this fact

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,250
and you can pause the
video while doing that.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,707
And then when you're ready
to check if your solution is

18
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,290
correct, bring the video back
up and I'll show you what I did.

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:09,390


20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,270
OK, welcome back.

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,960
Again what we wanted
to do is prove

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,901
this sort of pseudo product
rule for the del operator.

23
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,400
And what we're doing
is we're trying

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,900
to see what happens if
you have a vector field

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,210
and you multiply it
by a scalar function

26
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,897
and you apply the
del operator to that.

27
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,730
So we're going to see
if we actually come up

28
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,813
with what we should on the
right-hand side, which,

29
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:31,330
since I'm calling it a
rule, we really hope we do.

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,570
In fact, we will.

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,060
So let me start off.

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,830
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write symbolically

33
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,722
what the left-hand side means.

34
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,680
And then we're going to
break it up into pieces

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,700
and show you get, in
fact, what you would

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,350
get on the right-hand side.

37
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,000
So symbolically,
what do we have?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,590
Oh actually, first
I'm going to call F--

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,010
the components of F,
as is usually done

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,550
in lecture--
capitals P, Q, and R.

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,270
So those will be
the components of F.

42
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,100
That's how we've been
denoting this, usually.

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
And notice that if we wanted
F to be a vector field in two

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,310
dimensions, we'd just
make R 0, and then we'd

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,954
have a vector field
in two dimensions.

46
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:09,884
So we can certainly
do that if we want,

47
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,800
but we're going to prove
it in a little more--

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
in the three-dimensional case.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,970
So remember that del dotted with
any vector field is supposed

50
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,010
to be-- symbolically, what was
written was you should think

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:32,050
about this as del, del x, comma
del, del y, comma del, del z,

52
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,120
dotted with this
vector field, u*F.

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,370
Now what is this vector field?

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,120
Because u is a scalar, when I
multiply u by the vector field

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,520
F, the components are going to
be u capital P comma u capital

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,620
Q comma u capital R. So
those are my components.

57
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,120
Now symbolically,
this is what we've

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,920
seen when we're looking at the
del operator acting on a vector

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
field.

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,719
So what do we actually do?

61
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,260
Well, what we actually
do, of course,

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,150
is we take the x derivative
of the first component,

63
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,380
we take the y derivative
of the second component,

64
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,130
and we take the z derivative
of the third component.

65
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,080
And then we add those together.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,210
So it's really a symbolic
idea of a dot product.

67
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,410
It's not a true
dot product here.

68
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,530
But let's actually write
down what we get there.

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,050
We get del del x of
the quantity u*P,

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,610
plus del del y of the
quantity u*Q plus del del z

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,330
of the quantity u*R. That's
exactly what this symbolically

72
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,210
means is this, what I've
written in the next line down.

73
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,390
So maybe I should
write equals again.

74
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,300
This is another equals.

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,090
The top thing equals
the next line down,

76
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,173
equals the next line down.

77
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,870
And just to have it nice and
even I'll put the equals there,

78
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,890
so when we look back
it's easy to see.

79
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,320
Now how do I deal with this?

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,170
Well, notice that u is a
function and P is a function.

81
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,020
Why is that?

82
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,120
Because P was a component
of a vector field.

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,727
So it is just a function that
is in the first component

84
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:04,560
of the vector field.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,230
P, Q, and R are all
individually functions

86
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,920
that depend on x, y, and z.

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,210
So here, at this
step, I can actually

88
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,060
take the regular product
rule we have for functions.

89
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,980
And I can do it in this
one, this one, and this one.

90
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,586
And what I'm going to do, so I
don't have to write del del x

91
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:23,960
and del del y all
over the place,

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm going to use the subscripts
notation for derivatives.

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,970
So I'm going to write,
what this actually

94
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,410
equals is u sub x
times P plus u P sub x.

95
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,010
So here, the del del x is now
corresponding to a subscript.

96
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,830
So notice that I've just used
the product rule on functions

97
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,530
at this step, because u is a
function and P is a function.

98
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,130
I can do the same thing for
the y derivative of u*Q.

99
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:59,869
I get u sub y Q plus u Q sub y.

100
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:02,160
And then the last component,
I do the same thing for z.

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,680
I get u sub z R plus u R sub z.

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,850
Now if I made a mistake it
will become very apparent

103
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,730
in the next moment.

104
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,874
But I don't think
I made a mistake.

105
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,540
I want to remind us
where we want to go,

106
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,790
and then we'll see if we
have the pieces to get there.

107
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,950
So I'm going to go back over
to the side we have over here.

108
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,430
And I want to remind
you, we started off

109
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,600
with a del operator acting on
this vector field u times F,

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,750
capital F. And what
we'd like to see

111
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,090
is if we can get this to
equal the gradient of u

112
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,650
dotted with the vector
field plus u times

113
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,150
the del operator acting on F.

114
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,910
So let's see if
we can first find

115
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,890
components of the vector
field and components

116
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,251
of the gradient of u.

117
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,500
And let's see where those are.

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,170
They're actually very
nicely placed here.

119
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,750
Notice that this
underlined component

120
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,520
is the first component
of gradient u

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880
and the first component of F.
And this underlined component

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,100
is the second component
of gradient of u

123
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,740
and the second component of
F. And this third underlined

124
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,660
component here is the
third component of grad u

125
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,310
and the third component of F.

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,120
So if I take those three
components together--

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm going to write
the equals up here--

128
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,292
I get exactly grad
u dotted with F.

129
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,500
That's the first thing I get.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,660
And then I'm going to
see what else I get.

131
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,550
But let me just make sure you
understand, look at these three

132
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,010
underlined components together.

133
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,890
You get u sub x times P plus
u sub y times Q plus u sub z

134
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,240
times R. Well, [u x, u y, u z]
is the gradient vector field

135
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,180
for u, and [P, Q, R] is
F. So when I dot those,

136
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,520
I get exactly u_x*P
plus u_y*Q plus u_z*R.

137
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,050
You notice these two, or
the dot product of this,

138
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,040
gives you those
three components.

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,660
And now there are three
components remaining.

140
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,860
Notice what they
all have in common.

141
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,740
They all have a u
in the first spot.

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,050
And then it's
multiplied by P sub x,

143
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,160
and then here it's
multiplied by Q sub y,

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,750
and here it's
multiplied by R sub z.

145
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,340
But that is exactly-- P sub
x plus Q sub y plus R sub

146
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,627
z is exactly the del operator
acting on this vector field F.

147
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,460
So this is something
you've seen previously.

148
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,305
So I'm going to do
these as squiggles.

149
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:23,890


150
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,690
That's exactly equal to u times
the del operator of this vector

151
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,410
field F.

152
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,190
So again let me remind
you, del dot F actually

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,260
is going to give you P sub
x plus Q sub y plus R sub z.

154
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,820
And then if I multiply that
by a u, I get this u in front.

155
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,980
So what I have done is
for an arbitrary function

156
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,220
u-- I guess I've assumed
that function had

157
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,820
first derivatives so that
I could do all this stuff--

158
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,610
and for a vector field
that had first derivatives,

159
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,720
I showed that if I take
the del operator of u times

160
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,060
the vector field, I actually
get the gradient of u

161
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,690
dotted with the vector
field plus u times

162
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,220
the del operator of
the vector field.

163
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,757
So that is what
I wanted to show.

164
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,340
If you remember,
what I wanted to show

165
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,520
was exactly that sort of pseudo
product rule for this del

166
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,900
operator.

167
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,894
So I think that that
is where I'll stop.

168
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,310
I'm going to step
off to the side,

169
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,380
