JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.070
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.750
In lecture, you've been
learning about triple

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.730
integration, and I have a nice
average value problem for you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.610
using triple integration here.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.670
So what I'd like you to do is
to consider the tetrahedron

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670
that has vertices at the origin,
and at the points 1,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.750
0, 0, and 0, 1, 0,
and 0, 0, 1.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.400
So that's one point on each of
the positive axes at distance

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.360
1 from the origin.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.920
So I've taken the liberty of
drawing it here for you.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.620
So consider that solid
tetrahedron.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.580
And what I'd like you to do is
find the average distance of

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.900
the points in that tetrahedron
from the xy plane.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.640
All right.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.820
So I'd like you to compute the
average value of the distance

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.100
as the point ranges over the
whole tetrahedron of its

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.580
distance from the xy plane.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.590
So why don't you pause the
video, spend some time working

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.470
that out, come back, and we
can work it out together.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.250
Hopefully, you had some luck
with this problem.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.500
Let's get started.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.800
So the average value of a
function F over a region R is

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.370
going to be 1 over the volume of
the region times the triple

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.150
integral over your whole region
R of the function value

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.540
f of x, y, z with respect to
volume, in any order you want.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.990
So I guess I'll write dv here,
and then to evaluate this, you

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.730
set it up as an iterated
integral.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.740
So in our case, the function
we're trying to find the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.810
average value of is the distance
between a point and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.070
the xy plane.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.770
But that's an easy
function, right?

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.310
That's just z.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.950
For any point in space, its
distance from the xy plane is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.770
just its height.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.790
It's z-value.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.620
So the function that we're
seeking to find the average

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.250
value of is z, and so most of
the work of this problem then

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.560
is going to be in figuring out
what the bounds are and then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.850
doing the actual integral
after that.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.830
So OK.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.890
So let's think about
the bounds.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.430
This tetrahedron is
a nice, reasonably

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.810
simple, geometric object.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.570
So in fact, it doesn't matter
too much which order you take

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.320
your bounds.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.460
So I think I'm going to do
it in the order dz dy dx.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.320
You know, I'll do z first,
and then y, and then x.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.350
But it doesn't matter.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.500
If you do it a different way,
it'll probably work out very

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.890
similarly overall, and you'll
still be able to compare the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.330
overall process.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.610
So let's think about z.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.000
Yeah?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.750
So in this tetrahedron, we want
to integrate with respect

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.780
to z first. So we look at this
tetrahedron and we say, OK, at

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.490
a point when we choose the x-
and y-values, what's the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.580
lowest surface-- what's the
smallest value z can take--

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.550
and what's the upper surface--
what's the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.060
largest value z can take?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.500
So the lowest surface here
is the xy plane.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.490
That's the bottom face
of this tetrahedron.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.030
And for any choice of x and y,
the lowest value z can take is

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.710
when it's in the xy plane.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.960
So when it's equal to 0.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.530
So this is going to be equal,
so in our case, so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.230
let's set this up.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.241
So it's going to be an
iterated integral.

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.760
The function we're integrating
is z, and I said

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.500
we'll do dz dy dx.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.070
And we just said that the lowest
value that z takes--

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.970
the dz--

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.660
is 0.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.330
So the up-highest value that
z takes is when it

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.250
hits this top surface.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.660
This plane that passes through
the point (1, 0, 0), (0, 1,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.760
0), and (0, 0, 1).

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.030
All right.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.030
So we need to know the equation
of that plane.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.990
Luckily, that's a pretty easy
plane to write down the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.470
equation for.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.050
So this slanted plane passing
through the three vertices

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.680
other than the origin is
the plane x plus y

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.465
plus z equals 1.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.160
All right.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.500
So it's a nice, easy
plane to work with.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.180
And so what we want to know
is what's the value

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.450
of z on that plane.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.620
So we isolate z on one
side and we bring

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.200
everything else over.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.810
So we have that top value of z,
the largest value of z that

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.680
z can take when x and y are
fixed, is 1 minus x minus 1.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.930
So that's what goes up here.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.360
So that's the biggest
value z can take.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.460
OK, good.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.410
So now we need to figure out
what the bounds on y are in

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.880
terms of x.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.880
So what I like to do in this
case is I like to draw a

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.110
projection of your surface.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.090
So then you're in a
two-dimensional world, and

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.370
then you can look at that
image more easily.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.950
So what we're going to do is
we're going to look at this

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.330
tetrahedron and we're going to
imagine projecting it down

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.480
into the xy plane.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.450
So for every point in the
tetrahedron, we're going to

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.800
draw a dot below it
in the xy plane.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.070
And then we're going to look
at that set of dots.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.280
So what that's going to give us
is this bottom face of the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.060
tetrahedron.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.520
Every point of the tetrahedron
is above its bottom face.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.460
That's not true for every
tetrahedron, but it's

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.160
true for this one.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.890
So the region that we're
interested in

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.930
is that bottom face.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.270
So I'm going to draw another
picture of it

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.780
over on my left here.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:39.390
So that region is the region
that has vertices (0, 0), and

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.370
(1, 0), and (0, 1).

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.050
So it's this triangle.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.540
And this bottom edge of
the triangle is the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.860
line y equals 0.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.770
This left edge is the
line x equals 0.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.490
And this slanted line is the
line x plus y equals 1.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.310
OK, so this is that same bottom
face that we just drew.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.970
But now I've changed my axes to
our usual two-dimensional

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.550
direction with x to the
right and y up.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.560
OK.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.000
So we're doing dy next.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.370
So we need to figure out for a
fixed value of x, what are the

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.270
bounds on y?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.580
So we see from this picture that
for any fixed value of x,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.130
y goes from 0--

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.140
the x-axis--

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.760
up to this line.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.330
OK?

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.790
So on the x-axis, y takes the
value 0, and on this line, y

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.640
takes the value 1 minus x.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.910
Finally, our outermost variable
of integration is x,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.180
and so we need to know what are
the absolute largest and

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.400
smallest values that x takes.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.500
So we can do that looking either
at this picture or

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.650
looking at our original
picture.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.010
Either way, it's not hard
to see that x just goes

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.250
between 0 and 1.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.770
The smallest value that
x takes in this

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.680
tetrahedron is 0.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.320
The largest value
it takes is 1.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.430
So that's our integral that
we have to compute.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.350
So that's not that bad at all.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.050
So now you have to go through
and you have to actually

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.310
integrate this.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.800
Yeah?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.880
And so I'm going to look at my
notes just to make sure I

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.620
don't make any big arithmetic
mistakes.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.930
So let's see.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.920
Now we do these one at a time.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.470
So this innermost integral
is an integral of z dz.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.310
OK, well that's easy.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.020
That's z squared over 2.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.010
And then we're taking z squared
over 2 between 0 and 1

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.250
minus x minus y.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:42.520
So this innermost integral is z
squared over 2 between 0 and

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.270
1 minus x minus y.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.210
So that's equal to what the
innermost integral gives us,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:54.170
which is 1 minus x minus
y squared over 2.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.040
So that's what we get for
the innermost integral.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.470
So our integral that we're
looking at then is equal to

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.430
the integral as x goes from 0
to 1, of the integral as y

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.190
goes from 0 to 1 minus
x of this integrand.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.250
So this is the inner one.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.500
Let me write that.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.170
That's what I've got here.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.420
Just integrating z with respect
to z gives me z

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.420
squared over 2.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.010
And then I evaluated at the
bounds of the integral.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.080
OK, so now I need to
do the middle one.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.570
So let's do that up here.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.540
So I need to compute
the integral.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.625
So now I take the bounds for the
middle one is y, and the

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:44.940
bounds are from 0 to 1 minus
x of the inner integral.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.270
This thing that I
just computed.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:56.820
So that's of 1 minus x minus
y squared over 2, dy.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.390
OK.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.060
So All right.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.940
So this isn't that bad.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.170
This is a quadratic
polynomial in y.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.440
And so it's not terribly
hard to see.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.990
I'm running a little bit
out of board space.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:14.090
So I'm not going to give you a
full, detailed explanation.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:23.900
But it's not hard to see, I
think, that this integral of 1

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:32.360
minus x minus y squared over 2
with respect to y is 1 minus x

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.540
minus y cubed over 3, but it's
negative, because the sign

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.150
here is negative.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.970
And you could check by
differentiating this and

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.030
seeing that you get that.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.290
And so we have to evaluate
that as y goes from

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.350
0 to 1 minus x.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.040
So what do we get?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.050
Well, when y is equal to
one minus x, this is 0.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.160
So we get 0 minus--

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.840
and when y is equal to 0, this
is minus 1 minus x quantity

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.090
cubed over 6--

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.760
so it's minus minus, so that's
just 1 minus x cubed over 6.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:18.530
And so finally the outermost
integral is we take the inner

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.280
two integrals and we integrate
them with respect to x as x

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.600
goes from 0 to 1.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.540
So it's the integral from
0 to 1 of 1 minus x

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.590
cubed over 6, dx.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.640
And that's going to equal--

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.890
I've run out of space--

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.430
1 over 24.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.760
All right.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.080
Except I've done something wrong
right at the beginning.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.980
I hope you all caught me.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.540
Right?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.100
I had this 1 over v factor
here, and it disappeared.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.340
Right?

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.730
I forgot about this 1 over v,
so over here, I should have

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.170
written 1 over v right in
front of that integral.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.700
I've correctly computed 1 over
24 as the value of my triple

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.750
integral, but the average height
here isn't 1 over 24.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.720
It's 1 over 24v. All right.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.610
So the average height is 1 over
24v, and so we need to go

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.190
and we need to look at our
tetrahedron and figure out

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.430
what its volume is.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.560
So if we come over here and
see our tetrahedron.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.960
Now this is nice, simple
tetrahedron.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.320
The volume of a tetrahedron is
1/3 the area of the base times

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.170
the height, right?

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.540
So this is a nice,
easy tetrahedron.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.860
Its height is 1.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.610
Its base is a right triangle
whose legs are both 1.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.990
So the base area is 1/2,
so the volume is 1/6.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.070
So if the volume is 1/6, and we
said the average value is 1

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.020
over 24v, so that works
out to 1 over 4.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.170
So let me write that
just in this space.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:03.500
So the average height
then is 1 over 4.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.860
So that's going to be
our final answer.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.700
OK, so let's just recap
briefly what we did.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.950
We had an average value problem
that we started with.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.250
So we use this general formula
for average value problems.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.030
When you have a function f
that you want to take its

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.790
average value of over a region
R, what do you do?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.120
Well, you take 1 over the volume
of the region times the

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.360
triple integral of your function
f with respect to

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.800
volume over that region.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.110
OK.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.850
So this is the average
value in general.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.845
In our particular case, the
function was the height.

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.690
It was z.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.240
And then you have to set it out
choosing the proper bounds

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.660
for your integrals.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.370
So in this case, you choose
some order of integration

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.250
based on the region.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.270
In this particular case, it's
a nice, simple region.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.015
It doesn't matter too much
what order you choose.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.380
So I chose dz dy dx.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.410
And then what does that mean?

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.580
So for the innermost one, you
look at your original solid.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.080
So I'm going to go back and look
at this picture again.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.510
So for your innermost variable
you say-- so if it's z-- you

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.400
say, so when I fix x and y,
what's the bottom surface and

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.210
what's the top surface when
I solve that for z in

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.210
terms of x and y?

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.690
So here, that was the plane z
equals 0, and the plane z

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.250
equals 1 minus x minus y.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.020
So that explains my
bounds over here.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.940
Why they were 0 and
1 minus x minus y.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.880
Then, when you go to your
next variable-- in this

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.980
case, it was y--

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.740
what do you do?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.310
Well, first you project to
eliminate this first variable.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.190
So you project your
region down.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.010
Down in this case,
because it's z.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.350
So you project in
the z-direction.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.600
And you draw this shadow
of your region.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.850
So this is what I drew here.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.610
This is the shadow of my region
in the xy plane after I

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.490
projected it.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.630
And then you do the
same thing.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.070
So now this just like what you
did when you had to find

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.600
bounds for double integrals,
when you wrote them as

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.550
iterated integrals a
few lectures ago.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.380
And so then you do
the same thing.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.490
So then in this case, I
was next integrating

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.290
with respect to y.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.180
So I needed to find the bounds
on y with respect to x.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.410
So I needed to look in this
picture at the bottom edge and

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.050
the top edge of this region.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.220
And then your outermost
variable, you look at its

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.440
absolute bounds.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.460
So the largest and smallest
value it takes on the region.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.030
OK, then you have an iterated
integral and you evaluate it

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.330
by successive integrations.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.090
OK.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.110
So that was what we did.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.840
We just did the three integrals,
starting from the

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.300
inside and working our way out.
