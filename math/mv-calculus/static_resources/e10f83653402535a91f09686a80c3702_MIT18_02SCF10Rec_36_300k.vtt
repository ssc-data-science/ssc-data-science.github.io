CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.100
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem:

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.210
So given the region r shown
below, which I'll mention more

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.970
of in a moment, compute the
integral double integral over

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.900
r of the quantity 4x squared
minus y squared to the fourth

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.390
dx dy, and I want you to do it
by changing variables to u is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.930
equal 2x minus y and v is
equal to 2x plus y.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.120
And the region defined down here
is just these three line

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.450
segments and the intersection of
the region bounded by these

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.490
three line segments.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.180
So one of them is a portion of
the y-axis, one of the them is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.530
a portion of the line defined
by 2x minus y equals 0, and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.720
one of them is a portion of
the line defined by 2x

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.690
plus y equals 2.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.150
So why don't you do this, make
sure you use this change of

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.410
variables, and then I'll come
back, and I'll draw the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.410
accompanying region in the u,
v plane, and then we'll see

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.880
how I set it up.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.720
OK, welcome back.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.980
Well, the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.390
draw the region in the u, v
plane that is determined by

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.090
this region in the x, y plane
and the change of variables.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.710
Now, as was mentioned in the
lecture, all of the changes

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.010
are linear, and so I'm going to
be taking lines to lines.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.550
So what I'm going to do is
determine at each endpoint

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.570
here where that endpoint goes
under the transformation, and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.230
then I will connect the dots.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.980
So what do I get?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.400
Well, this first one is 0, 0
for x and y, and so that

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.420
corresponds to x and y are 0
here, so u is 0, and x and y

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.300
are 0 here, so it would be a 0,
so that's the point 0, 0 on

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
the u, v plane.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.860
Now, I want to mention something
here is that based

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.460
on how these lines were defined,
this is telling you

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.700
that all along this line 2x
minus y equals 0, that means u

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.640
is equal to 0 all along
that segment.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.550
And if you'll notice also, 2x
plus y is equal to 2 here, so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.020
v is equal to 2 all along
this segment.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.250
So we should expect whatever u
is, v's going to be 2 here,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.580
and whatever v is here,
u is going to be 0.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.220
OK, so I'm going to have
something with u, 0 initially,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.740
and then v, 2, I can already
expect, it's going to come up

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.290
here and move over that way.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.570
But let's just check.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.210
So this is the point 0, 2,
0 for x and 2 for y.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.400
Let's see what it is in
the u, v variables.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.030
So u in that case is negative 2
and v in that case is 2, and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.340
so I'm going to go
left 2 and up 2.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.210
This might not be drawn to
scale, but this is negative 2,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.040
and this is up 2 here, and so
that's where this point goes

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.920
in the transformation.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.560
This point is 1/2 comma 1.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.460
You can actually check
what it is.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.880
But actually, as I mentioned,
you already know what has to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.670
happen, because this segment is
connected right here, and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.040
then we said all along this
line, v is 2, and all along

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.120
this line, u is 0, and
so that actually

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.290
carves out that rectangle.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.570
So if you were worried and you
weren't able to do it that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.430
way, what you could actually
do is say, well, where does

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.170
the point 1/2, 1 go?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.640
If I plug in 1/2 for x and 1 for
y, I notice that I get u

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.480
equals 0 and v equals 2,
and that's this point.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.950
And so now, I'm looking
at this region.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.060
Now, these two things are not
drawn to the scale, because

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.150
what I want to point out is
they're both triangles.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.160
It's easy to find the area based
on how they're sitting

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.400
in two-dimensional space.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.430
So what we see here is if I
wanted to find the area of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.830
this triangle, let's
make this the base.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.620
The base is 2 and the height is
1/2, so 1/2 of base times

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.470
height is--

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.510
that area is equal to 1/2.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.570
So the area of r is 1/2, and
what's the area of this one?

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.650
The area this one is-- well,
I've got base 2 and height 2,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.070
and so it's 1/2 of 2 times
2, and so that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.140
gives me area as 2.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.230
So here the area is 1/2, here
the area is 2, and so notice

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.730
that I've multiplied by 4 to
get from here to here.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.020
So I can anticipate that I
should have-- based on the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.700
principle you saw in lecture,
I should have something like

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.660
du dv is going to be equal
to 4 times dx dy.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.250
That is what I expect to get.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.580
Now let's see if when we
do the Jacobian, we

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.710
get the same thing.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.640
Let me double check, right?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.920
This is area 2, this is area
1/2, so I have 1/2 times 4 is

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.530
going to give me 2.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.780
Yeah, that's what
I should get.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.510
Oops!

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.100
That sticks out a little.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.340
So now let's just check our
Jacobian and see if that is

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.990
indeed what we get.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.450
So I'm going to look at
u sub x, u sub y, v

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.350
sub x, v sub y, right?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.840
So u sub x is 2, u sub y is
negative 1, so I get 2,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.050
negative 1.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.130
v sub x is 2, v sub y
is 1, so I get 2, 1.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.860
2 times 1 is 2 minus negative
2 gives me, indeed, 4.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.930
So I do get, in fact, du
dv is equal to 4 dx dy.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.200
So I know that I'm going to have
to-- because I'm changing

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.090
variables, though, from dx dy to
du dv, I'm going to divide

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.570
by 4, obviously, when I
do the substitution.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.850
The substitution will be
replacing just dx dy.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.070
So I just mention that, but
notice: Again, we get what we

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.640
expect to get.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.190
We got a 4 based on the picture
and we got a 4 based

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.950
on the Jacobian.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.420
And so now, we need to finish
up the process.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.530
We need to figure out how to
write this in terms of u and v

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.030
and then figure out our bounds
in terms of u and v, and then

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.720
we're done.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.720
So let me mention, one thing
you should notice is that u

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.930
times v is equal to exactly--

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.250
this is going to be a difference
of two squares, and

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.410
it is precisely 4x squared
minus y squared.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.300
If you need to multiply it out
to check, you can check it,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.410
but that's indeed what it is,
which is why this particular

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.260
substitution is quite nice,
because that means this

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.420
function I'm supposed to be
integrating is just uv raised

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.030
to the fourth.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.370
So I'm almost done.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.270
So let me write in the pieces I
know, and then we'll fill in

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.380
the last two spots, or four
spots, which will be all the

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.360
bounds on the integral.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.300
So I'm going to write it here,
give myself some space to

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.960
write the bounds.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.680
So I'm replacing the 4x squared
minus y squared by a

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.960
uv, so I'm going to get u
times v, and then the

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.370
function, that is raised to
the fourth in the initial

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.450
problem, so I raise that
to the fourth.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.660
Then dx dy, as I mentioned, will
be replaced by a du dv

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.190
divided by 4.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.095
And so I can just put this
over 4 and write du dv. I

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.780
should be careful which
order I want to do.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.960
It doesn't really matter.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.250
I can do either one.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.990
du dv, OK?

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.380
And so now I want to know what
u goes from and to and then

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.600
what v has to go from and to.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.780
So if I come over here, you'll
see it didn't matter, because

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.540
I could have picked either
direction to go.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.210
But if I'm going to go with u,
I'm coming from whatever this

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.790
function is over
to here, right?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.330
And this value here is easy.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.930
That's u equals 0.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.560
So the top bound for u is 0,
and the bottom bound for u,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.400
this is v is equal to minus u,
so the bottom bound for u is

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.510
when u is equal to negative
v. So I'm running from--

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.020
because I put the du on the
inside, my first one is

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.140
running from minus v to--
what did I say--

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.940
0, and then the v values from
there go between 0 and 2.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.320
You can see this easily
from the picture.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.370
So they go between zero and 2.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.290
And I am not going to finish it
off from here, because it

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.480
would require not
too much work.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.430
It's actually quite simple,
because it's just a polynomial

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.600
and u and a polynomial and v,
but there are a lot of powers

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.300
and there will be
big powers of 2.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.730
So suffice it to say, at this
point, we can evaluate this

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.850
integral and it's quite
easy to evaluate.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.380
And the main point I think we
should make is how did it make

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.320
it simpler?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.300
I mean, the initial problem, if
we come over here, this is

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.250
annoying to find an
anti-derivative, but not

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.350
impossible.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.490
But the really annoying part is
I would have to take this

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.680
region and split it into a bunch
of pieces, or at least

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.100
two pieces, to evaluate the
integral in a reasonable way

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.090
or my y-values would go
from this line here up

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.690
to this line here.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.170
It could be complicated.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.260
So what we've really done is
we've simplified the region.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.510
That's the easiest thing.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.100
I mean, we also simplified the
function, but we've really

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.350
simplified the region we're
integrating over.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.060
And so we only have one is
a function and one is a

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.530
constant, and that's quite nice
to have on the inside.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.880
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
