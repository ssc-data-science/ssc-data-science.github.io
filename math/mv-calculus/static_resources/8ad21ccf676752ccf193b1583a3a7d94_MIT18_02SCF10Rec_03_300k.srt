JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,260
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,200
In lecture, among other things,
you've been learning

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,780
about computing components of
one vector in the direction of

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,390
another vector.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,230
So I have a straightforward
problem about

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,090
that for you here.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,730
So we've got two vectors.

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,170
The vector 2i minus 2j plus k.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,080
And we've got the vector
i plus j plus k.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,610
And so what I'd like you to do
for me is to compute the

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,740
component of this first vector
in the direction

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,090
of the second vector.

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,040
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,130
that out, come back, and we
can work on it together.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:47,470

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,320
Welcome back.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,610
So hopefully you had some
luck with this problem.

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,290
Now this problem is pretty
straightforward.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,680
Really all you have to do is
remember what the definition

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,360
of component is.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,220
And after that, it's
smooth sailing.

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,280
So in particular, the component
of one vector in the

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,870
direction of another is the
length of what you get when

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,610
you project this vector
onto that one, well,

27
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,640
plus a sign, right?

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,850
So if the projection is in the
same direction, then it's

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,680
positive, or if it's
in the opposite

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,000
direction, it's negative.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,490
So let me draw a picture
of what I mean by that.

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:32,080
So if you have a vector V and
you have another vector W,

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,642
then the projection of V onto W
is what you get if you make

34
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:43,370
a, drop a perpendicular line
there, and then it's just this

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,060
vector here.

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,750
So that's the projection.

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,930
And then the component is the
length of that projection.

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,620
Again, with the sign
if necessary.

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,480
And so we can see since this
is going to be a right

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,470
triangle here, we can see that
this vector has length that's

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:08,730
just given by the length of V.
So the length-- rather-- the

42
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:20,860
component of V in direction
W is, so it's just the

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,890
length of V, right.

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,480
That's the length of
the hypotenuse--

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,100
times the cosine of the
angle between them--

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,460
so it's times cosine of theta.

47
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,120
Now this length of V times
cosine theta, this should

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
remind you of something.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,490
This looks very much like this
formula we had for the dot

50
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,400
product, right?

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,240
So another way of writing this
is to say that this is equal

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,710
to V dot W.

53
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,250
So V dot W is the length of V
times the length of W times

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,470
the cosine of the angle.

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,000
And so here we just have the
length of V times the cosine

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,610
of the angle.

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:02,070
So we have to divide this
through by the length of W. So

58
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,100
this is what the component is,
and this is the simple formula

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,620
for it if you're given V and
W in some easy-to-use form.

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,250
And indeed in this problem,
we're given V and W just in

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,840
they're nice coordinate forms.

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,310
So we're given that our vector
V that we want the component

63
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,920
of is 2i minus 2j plus k.

64
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,660
And the direction W that we're
looking at is i plus j plus k.

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,580
So in our case, we just have to
compute these expressions V

66
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,120
dot W and the length of W in
order to put them into this

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
formula, and then
we'll be done.

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:47,270
So in our case, V dot W-- well,
that's straightforward

69
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,920
because we're given V and
W in coordinates--

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,650
so this is just 2 times
1 plus minus 2 times 1

71
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,710
plus 1 times 1.

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,460
So that's, OK, 2 minus
2 plus 1 is 1.

73
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,690
And the length of W-- well, you
know, it's just your usual

74
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,836
length formula--

75
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:13,040
is 1 squared plus 1 squared
plus 1 squared, the whole

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,460
thing is square rooted,
which is equal to the

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,260
square root of 3.

78
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,570
So we've got V dot W and we have
the length of W, and so

79
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,720
then we just need to put them
right into this formula.

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,370
That the component of V in the
direction of W is given by

81
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,620
this expression.

82
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,450

83
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,100
So the component of--

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,913
I'm not going to write it out
with i's, j's, and k's, I'm

85
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,650
going to write--

86
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,535
2, minus 2, 1.

87
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:47,670

88
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:55,060
And direction 1, 1, 1 is, well
we just have to divide the dot

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,520
product by the length of
the direction vector.

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,950
So that's 1 divided by
the square root of 3.

91
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,300
So that's that, I'll
end there.

92
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,640
