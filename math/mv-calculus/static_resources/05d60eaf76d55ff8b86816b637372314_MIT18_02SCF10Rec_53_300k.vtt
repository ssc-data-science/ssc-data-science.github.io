00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.250
I have a nice exercise here
for you that tests your

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.460
knowledge of triple
integration.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
So in particular I've got
for you a cylinder.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
And my cylinder has height
h and it has radius b.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.170
And this is the kind
of cylinder I like.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.920
It's a constant density
cylinder.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.680
So its density is just
1 everywhere.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.180
So what I'd like you to do is
for the cylinder I'd like you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.390
to compute its moment
of inertia

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.510
around its central axis.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.510
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at that, come

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.360
back, and you can check your
work against mine.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.640
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.350
Let's talk about it.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.980
So the first thing to notice
is that there aren't any

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.020
coordinates in this problem.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.420
I've given you a cylinder but
it's up to you to choose

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.810
coordinates, a way to arrange
your cylinder in space or a

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.860
way to arrange your coordinates
with respect to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.590
your cylinder.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
So a convenient thing to do in
this case is going to be-- you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.690
know, we're working with respect
to the central axis of

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.400
the cylinder.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.440
So let's make that
one of our axes.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.800
So in particular why don't
we make it our z-axis.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.210
That seems like a natural
sort of thing to do.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.160
So let me try and draw a
little picture here.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.655
So we've got our cylinder.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.980
And there it is with our
3 coordinate axes.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.365
I guess it's got radius b
and it's got height h.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.610
Now we've arranged it, now we
have coordinates, so now we

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.290
want to see what it is we're
trying to do with it.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830
So we're trying to compute
a moment of inertia.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.430
So we have to remember what
a moment of inertia means.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.270
So let me think.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.480
So a moment of inertia, when
you have a solid-- so your

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.130
moment of inertia I with respect
to an axis is what you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.010
get when you take the
triple integral.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.470
So let's say your solid is D.
Your solid D. So you take D.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.400
So you take a triple integral
over D and you're integrating

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.890
r squared with respect to
the element of mass.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.100
OK.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.210
So r squared here, this is the
distance from the axis around

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.030
which you're computing the
moment of inertia.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.860
And in our case, so in
any case, this little

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.870
moment of mass is--

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.560
sorry, little element
of mass--

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.000
is density times a little
element of volume.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.810
So we can also write this as the
triple integral over our

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.590
region of r squared times
delta times dV.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.060
OK, so this is what this
is in general.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.800
So now let's think about
it in our case.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.930
Well, in our case, we've
cleverly chosen our central

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.940
axis to be the z-axis.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.100
So this r is just the distance
from the z-axis.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.100
This I was kind enough to give
you a constant density

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.560
cylinder, so this
delta is just 1.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.590
That's going to be easy.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.640
And then we have this
triple integral

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.900
over the whole cylinder.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.250
So we want a triple integral
over the whole cylinder of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.800
some integrand that
involves r.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.370
So a natural thing to do
in this situation--

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.930
the natural sort of thing to do
when you have a cylinder or

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.780
anything that's rotationally
symmetric, and you have an

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.880
integrand that behaves nicely
with respect to rotation, that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.130
can be written easily in terms
of r, or r and theta--

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.575
is to do cylindrical
coordinates.

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.450
Is to think of cylindrical
coordinates.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.830
So in our case that means we
just need to figure out-- at

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.390
this point-- we need to figure
out how do we integrate over

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.390
the cylinder in cylindrical
coordinates?

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.700
So let's do it.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.950
So in our case, so it doesn't
matter too much what order we

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.430
do things in.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.910
So we need dV. We need to write
that in terms of the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.680
cylindrical coordinates.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.850
So that's dz, dr, and d theta.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.220
And so we know that dV
is r dz dr d theta.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.170
You might want some other order
there, but that's a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.270
good, nice order.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.100
It usually is the simplest
order to consider.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.170
So this moment of inertia in our
case is going to be this

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.680
triple integral.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.130
OK, so we said r squared
delta, r squared times

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.620
density, density is 1.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.100
So that's just r squared.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.610
And r, the distance to
the axis is r, the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.520
distance to the z-axis.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:11.830
So that's just r squared
times r dz dr d theta.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.880
So this is the integral we're
trying to compute, but we need

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.690
bounds, right?

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.430
It's a triple integral, it's a
definite integral, we need to

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.670
figure out what the bounds
are to evaluate it

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.760
as an iterated integral.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.050
So let's go look at this
little picture we drew.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.670
So I guess I didn't discuss
this, but I made a choice just

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.270
to put the bottom of the
cylinder in the xy plane and

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.060
the top at height h.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.560
It's not going to matter.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.920
If you had made some
other choice, it

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.130
would work out fine.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.610
So that means the z is
going from 0 to h,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.580
regardless of r and theta.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.980
So z is going from 0 to h.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.775
That's nice, let's put
that over here.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:51.470
z is the inside one.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.070
It's going from 0 to h.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.730
Then r is next.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.620
Well, this is also--

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.090
you know, cylinders are great
for cylindrical coordinates.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.610
Shocker, right, given the name.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.110
I know.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.630
So r is going from 0 to
what's the radius?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.700
Our radius was b.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.830
So r goes from 0 to
b, and that's true

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.640
regardless of theta.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.790
So back over here, if we have r
going from 0 to b and theta

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.620
is just going from 0 to 2 pi,
we're doing a full rotation

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.070
all the way around
the cylinder.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.400
So this is what our moment of
inertia is, and now we just

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.840
have to compute it.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.200
So we've got our inner
integral here is

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.670
with respect to z.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:39.150
So the inner integral is
the integral from 0 to

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.620
h of r cubed dz.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.140
And r cubed doesn't have
any z's in it.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.920
Fabulous.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.940
So that's just going to
be r cubed z, where z

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.190
goes from 0 to h.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.050
So that's h r cubed minus 0.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.490
So hr cubed.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.750
All right.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.570
So that's the inner.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.820
Now let's look at the
middle integral.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.140
So this is going to be
the integral as--

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.810
that's our r integral.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.710
So that's going from 0 to b.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.590
And what are we integrating?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.410
We're integrating the
inner integral.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.130
So the inner integral
was h r cubed.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.960
So we're integrating h r
cubed dr from 0 to b.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.730
All right, this is not
quite as easy.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.210
But h as a constant, we're
integrating r cubed r.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.770
I've done worse.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.040
You've done worse.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.410
So that's going to be h
r to the fourth over 4

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.130
between 0 and b.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.440
So OK.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.770
So that's h b to the fourth over
4 minus h times 0 to the

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.550
fourth over 4.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.710
So the second term's 0.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.550
So this is just equal to h times
b to the fourth over 4.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.590
And finally, we have our
outer most integral.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.010
So what was that integral?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.440
Well, that was the integral from
0 to 2 pi d theta of the

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.820
second integral.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.600
So this is of the
middle integral.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.660
So it's the integral from 0 to
2 pi d theta of the middle

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.740
integral which was h b
to the fourth over 4.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.800
And this is just a
constant again.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.940
Great.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.950
So this is hb to the fourth
over 4 times 2 pi.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.170
So what does that work out to?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:37.640
That's h b to the fourth
pi over 2.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.270
All right.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.160
So there you go.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.970
Now if you wanted to, you could
also rewrite this a

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.740
little bit, because you
could note that

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.660
this is pi h b squared.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.650
That's your volume
of your cylinder.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.760
And in fact, it's not just your
volume, it's your mass of

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.690
your cylinder, because it
had constant density 1.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:04.770
So you also could've written
this as mass times a

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.470
squared over 2.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.610
Sorry. b squared over 2.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.910
I don't know where
a came from.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.080
Mass times b squared.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.470
So you have some other options
for how you could write this

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:21.020
answer by involving the volume
and mass and so on.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.860
So let's just recap
very quickly.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.800
Why we did what we did.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.200
We had a cylinder.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.940
And so really, given a cylinder,
it was a natural

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.360
choice to look at cylindrical
coordinates.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.450
And once we had cylindrical
coordinates,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.270
everything was easy.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.060
So we just took our general form
of the moment of inertia,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.960
took the region in question, in
cylindrical coordinates it

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.970
was very, very easy to describe
this entire region.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.710
And then our integrals were
pretty easy to compute after

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.140
we made that choice.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.190
After we made that choice they
