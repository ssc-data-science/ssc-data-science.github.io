00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.330
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.870
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.040
In lecture, you've been learning
about the divergence

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.990
theorem, also known as Gauss'
theorem, and flux, and all

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.700
that good stuff.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.300
So I have a nice exercise
on it for you here.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.780
So what I want is I want you to
take F, and I want it to be

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.160
the field whose components are
x over rho cubed, y over rho

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.970
cubed, and z over rho cubed.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.260
So here, rho is your usual rho
from spherical coordinates.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.420
Rho is equal to the square
root of x squared plus y

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.990
squared plus z squared.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.520
And I want S to be the surface
of the box whose vertices are

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.640
plus or minus 2, plus or minus
2, plus or minus 2.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880
So it's a cubicle box.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.140
So what I'd like you to do, is
first in part a, I'd like you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.380
to show that the divergence of
F is 0, wherever the field F

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.890
is defined.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.860
In part b, what I'd like you to
think about is whether we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.530
can conclude from that, that the
flux through the surface

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.205
of S is equal to 0.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.040
All right.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.730
And in part c, what I'd like
you to do is to use the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.990
extended version of Gauss'
theorem-- or the extended

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050
version of the divergence
theorem--

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.960
in order to actually compute
the flux through S by

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.240
computing an integral.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.640
So why don't you pause the video
for a couple of minutes,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.350
work out this problem,
come back, and we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.600
can work it out together.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.960
Hopefully you had some luck
with this problem.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.410
Let's get started.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.920
Part a asks you to compute the
divergence of F. So in order

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.960
to compute that, we're going
to need to take the partial

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.020
derivatives of the components of
F. And in order to do that,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.610
at some point I'm going to
need to take a partial

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.540
derivative of rho.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.120
So let me first compute the
partial derivatives of rho,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.180
and that will save me a tiny
bit of work later.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.960
So rho is equal to the square
root of x squared plus y

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.940
squared plus z squared.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.200
So partial rho partial x--

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.970
well, you just apply your usual
chain rule here-- and I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.140
guess we get a half, but then we
get a 2 that cancels it, so

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.390
I think this works out to x
divided by the square root of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.335
x squared plus y squared plus
z squared, so that's

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:29.915
x divided by rho.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:30.440
All right.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.990
And I'm just going to keep rho
around here, because otherwise

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.650
I have to write out the square
root of x squared plus y

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.390
squared plus z squared over and
over again, and this is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.620
going to save me some effort
and would save you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.450
some effort as well.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.830
So OK.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.060
So this is rho.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.310
So this is d rho dx.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.220
So we want to take the x partial
of the first component

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.320
of F. So that's the x partial
of x over rho cubed.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.990
OK.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.920
And you just apply your
usual quotient rule,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.880
so what do we get?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.970
We get the derivative
of the top.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.540
So that's rho cubed minus--

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.030
OK, so the top is x times the
derivative of the bottom,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.160
which is going to be 3 rho
squared times x over rho--

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.890
so that's 3--

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.430
so we have an x-- so it's 3x
squared rho, divided by the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.850
bottom squared, which
is rho to the sixth.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.500
And I guess there's a common
factor of rho everywhere that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.700
we can cancel out.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.560
So this is equal to rho squared
minus 3x squared

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.490
divided by rho to the fifth.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.990
OK.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.500
So that's the x-partial
derivative of the first

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.070
component of F.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.540
Now we need the y-partial
derivative of the second

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.910
component of F, and the
z-partial derivative of the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.450
third component of F. But if you
go and look back at what

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.810
the formula for F was, you see
that this is a very, very

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.120
symmetric formula.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.290
So in order to get from the
first component to the second

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.870
component, we just change x to
y, and to get from the second

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.990
component to the third, we just
change y to z, because of

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.820
course rho treats x,
y, and z the same.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.650
So what does that mean?

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.560
Well, that means that the
partial derivatives are easy

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.910
to compute.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.340
Having computed this x-partial
derivative, we also get that

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.610
partial over partial y of the
second component-- which is y

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.720
over rho cubed--

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.310
is equal to rho squared
minus 3y squared,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.410
over rho to the fifth.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.180
And the last one we get, partial
over partial z of z

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.000
over rho cubed is equal
to rho squared minus--

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440
I'm getting a little
cramped here--

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.530
3z squared, over rho
to the fifth.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:17.210
And so adding these up, we get
that div F is equal to the sum

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.980
of those three things.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.000
So let's see what we've got.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.620
We've got a 3--

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.200
so the denominators are
all rho to the fifth.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.520
And we've got 3 rho squared
minus 3x squared minus 3y

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.070
squared minus 3z squared.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.520
So this is equal to 3 rho
squared minus 3x squared minus

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.780
3y squared minus 3z squared,
all over rho to the fifth.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.960
But of course, rho squared is x
squared plus y squared plus

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.260
z squared, so this numerator
is just 0.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.660
So this is equal to 0.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.090
OK.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.005
Which is what we thought
it should be.

00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:52.650
All right.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.170
Good.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.250
So that's part a.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.980
We just computed the partial
derivatives of F, and then

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.180
added them together to
get the divergence.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.480
And we found that, in fact,
yes, the divergence

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.610
was equal to 0.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.970
Great.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.070
So that's part a.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.580
So let's go look at
what part b was.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.490
Part b asks, can we conclude
that the flux through the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.305
surface S is 0?

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:12.930
All right.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.180
Now remember what the divergence
theorem says.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.860
The divergence theorem says
that the flux through a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.140
surface of a field is equal to
the triple integral of the

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.390
divergence of that field over
the interior, provided the

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.400
field is defined and
differentiable

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.730
and nice, or whatever.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.610
Everywhere inside.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.170
OK?

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.730
But this field has a problem.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.240
Almost everywhere, this field
is nicely behaved, but at 0,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.130
we have a real problem.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.110
We're dividing by 0.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.340
Right?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.090
So this field is not
defined at 0.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.230
So there's a single point in the
middle of this cube where

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.310
this field behaves badly.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.460
And that means we can't
apply the divergence

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.560
theorem inside this cube.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.100
So since we can't apply the
divergence theorem, we aren't

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.260
allowed to conclude immediately
that the flux

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.230
through this surface is 0.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.960
OK.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.070
So the answer is no.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.750
We can't conclude that the flux
through S is 0, because

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.765
one of the hypotheses
of the divergence

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.300
theorem isn't satisfied.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.700
Namely, the field isn't defined

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.650
everywhere inside the surface.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.590
OK.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.930
So the answer to b is no.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.390
OK, I'm just going
to write that.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.590
But it's no because the
hypotheses aren't satisfied.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.460
OK, so now let's
look at part c.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.570
So part c suggests, we can't
conclude that the flux is 0.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.030
So we still want to know
what the flux is.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.345
That's still an interesting
question, so part c suggests

00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:52.080
that maybe you can still use the
extended Gauss' theorem to

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.290
compute what this flux is.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.610
So let's think about how
we could do that.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.250
So remember what extended
Gauss' theorem says?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.430
Or extended divergence
theorem.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.860
I'm going to try and just say
Gauss' theorem from now on so

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.000
I stop having to say both.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.590
But I mean both.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.240
I mean, they're the same
theorem, right?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.490
OK.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.410
So Gauss' theorem says, when you
have a surface bounding a

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.380
region, the flux through the
surface is equal to the triple

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.380
integral of divergence over
the region, provided

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.850
everything is well-defined
and nice.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.790
Extended Gauss' theorem says,
this is still true if your

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.120
region has more than
one boundary.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.980
So for example, if your region
is a hollow something--

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.320
so if it's a spherical shell
that has an outside sphere and

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.270
an inside sphere--

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.160
then extended Gauss' theorem
says, OK, so

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.970
you do the same thing.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.650
You take the triple integral
of the divergence over the

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.710
solid region.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.810
And then you take the flux, but
you add up the flux over

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.970
all of the boundary pieces.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.000
So you add up the flux over the
outside boundary surface,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.540
and also, if there is
one, through any

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.340
other boundary surface.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.330
OK?

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.420
And those two things
are equal.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.920
So the total flux through all
of the boundary surface is

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.240
equal to the integral of
divergence over the whole

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.310
region bounded by
those surfaces.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.942
So how are we going
to use this?

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.790
We're trying to compute the
flux through a surface.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.210
OK, but we don't want to compute
a double integral if

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.220
we can avoid it.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.200
We don't want to compute
the surface integral.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.170
So what we'd like to do is we'd
like to find a convenient

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:44.390
region over which to compute
this integral to put us in a

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.030
situation where we can apply
extended Gauss' theorem.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.060
We can't use just the inside of
the cube, so we want some

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.160
other region.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.040
So what we're going to do is
we're going to walk over here.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.620
There are many possible things
you could do, but

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.970
this is a nice one.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.060
All right.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.530
One thing you could do is you
could take a big sphere.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.290
Take a big sphere.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.440
So we've got our cube here.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.320
This is the point 2, 2, 2, and
this is the point 2, 2, minus

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.900
2, and so on.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.800
So we've taken a big sphere of
radius R-- for some big R that

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.280
contains our surface S that
we're interested in-- that

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.180
completely contains the cube.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.500
OK?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.700
So why have we done that?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.950
Extended Gauss' theorem.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.360
OK, so what does extended Gauss'
theorem say for the

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.610
region between the sphere
and this cube.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.120
All right.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.710
So our cube is named S.
Let's call our sphere

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.290
S2, because why not?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.770
OK.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:08.970
And let's call the solid
region between

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.710
the cube and sphere--

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.620
just for convenience, let's
give it a name--

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.730
so--

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.100
we often call solid regions
D-- so let's call it D.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.710
So it's this spherical region,
but it has a cubical hole in

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.890
the middle of it.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.110
OK.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.070
So what does extended
Gauss' theorem say?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.820
So extended Gauss' theorem says
that the triple integral

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:45.130
over D of the divergence of F dV
is equal to the sum of the

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.650
fluxes through each
of the surfaces.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.990
But for this, we want the flux
out of the solid region.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.340
So for the sphere, the flux
out of the inside of the

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.290
sphere is the flux out
of the sphere.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:11.790
So that's integral over S2 of
F dot n, d surface area.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.150
But for the cube, the flux out
of this region is the flux

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.220
into the cube.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.170
Right?

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.860
Out here, you're living in a
region outside the cube, so

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.730
when you leave that region,
you're going into the cube.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.550
So this is the negative of the
flux that we really want.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:39.290
So this is minus the flux
through the cube of F dot n,

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.950
with respect to surface area.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.700
So remember, the signs here
are different, because I'm

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.750
taking this normal to be the
outward pointing normal to

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.820
both surfaces.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.900
The normal that points
away from the origin.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.940
But the normal pointing away
from the origin on the cube is

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.000
the normal that points into the
solid region instead of

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.980
the normal that points out
of the solid region.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.200
So that's why this
minus is here.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.040
OK.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.720
Whew.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.970
All right, so what
does this mean?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.910
So first of all, F is
well-defined everywhere in

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.000
this region D. The only
place F was badly

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.890
behaved was the origin.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.395
And this region doesn't contain
it, which is why this

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.920
trick works.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.550
So we've already computed that
the divergence of F is 0

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.870
everywhere.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.370
It's defined.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.540
So it's 0 on all of D,
and so this triple

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.470
integral is just 0.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.700
So if this triple integral is 0,
that means we can just add

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.210
the thing that we're interested
in to both sides,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:45.470
and we get that the surface
integral over the cube of F

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.950
dot n, with respect to surface
area, is equal to the surface

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:55.540
integral over the sphere
of F dot n, with

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.340
respect to surface area.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.640
OK.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.710
So we've converted this original
integral-- our flux

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.080
integral that we're interested
in-- and we found that it's

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.400
equal to this separate
flux integral

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.450
over a different surface.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.740
This time over a big sphere.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.310
OK, so that's nice.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.000
Why do we want to do that?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.090
Well, we want to do that because
F is a really nicely

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.980
behaved field with respect
to a sphere.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.150
F is a radial field.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.790
So F dot n is really
easy to understand.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:39.630
F dot n: n is a unit normal
and F is a radial field.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:45.820
So on a sphere, the normal
is radial, right?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.590
It's parallel to the
position vector.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.800
And F is radial.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.260
So they're both pointing in
exactly the same direction.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.340
So when you take that dot
product, n is the unit vector

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.740
in the same direction as F, so
when you dot that with F, you

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.440
just get the length of F. OK,
so what does that mean?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.240
That means over here, this
integrand is really easy to

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.510
understand.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:08.710
OK?

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:15.620
This integrand F dot n on the
sphere is just equal to the

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.960
length of the vector F.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.120
Now what is the length
of the vector F?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.870
Well, we know what F is.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.140
It's x over rho cubed, i hat
plus y over rho cubed, j hat

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.720
plus z over rho cubed, k hat.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.790
So OK, so you compute the length
of that vector, and

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.480
what do you get?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.020
Well, it's exactly 1
over rho squared.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.740
OK.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.350
But we said that this
is a sphere.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.650
I guess I didn't
write it down.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.260
Let me write it down
right here.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.910
This is a sphere whose radius
is big R. It doesn't really

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.230
matter very much what R we
choose, we just want it to be

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.170
big enough so that it contains
the whole cube.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.320
If you said this a sphere
of radius 10, that would

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.420
completely do the trick.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.300
That would be totally fine.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.120
OK, so the radius of the sphere
is big R, so the length

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.590
of the field-- we said
back over here--

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.900
is 1 over R squared.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:18.330
The length of the vector F. So
this flux integral then, is

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.070
the integral over the sphere--

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.690
S2--

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.940
of a constant.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.020
So it's the integral over
the sphere of 1

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.440
over R squared, dS.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.400
But when you integrate a
constant over a surface, what

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.060
you get is just that constant
times the surface area.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.370
Well, what's the surface area?

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.090
This is a sphere.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.955
It's easy to understand
its surface area.

00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:45.690
Its surface area is
4 pi R squared.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.300
Right?

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.680
So this is equal to the surface
area, so that's 4 pi R

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.160
squared, times whatever
that constant was.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.220
So the constant was
1 over R squared.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.460
And so the R squared's cancel.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:58.720
Right?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.700
This is why it didn't matter
what R we chose, because

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.810
they're just going to cancel
at the end, anyhow.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.240
OK, so those cancel, and
we're left with 4 pi.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.880
So let's just quickly recap what
we did in this part c.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.630
We're looking to compute
the flux over the cube.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.390
But it's a kind of unpleasant
integral we'd have to compute

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.980
to total up the fluxes over
these various, different

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.150
faces and so on.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.510
So instead, we had this clever
idea that we'll apply the

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.410
divergence theorem to replace
the cube with a

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.110
more congenial surface.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.160
Because this is a nice
radial vector field,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.020
that's our main hint.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.500
Because there was a rho
involved in the

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.370
problem, if you will.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.420
So the surface that we choose
is some big sphere.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.270
And then we apply the extended
Gauss' theorem to the solid

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.120
region between the cube
and the sphere.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.760
Outside the cube, but
inside the sphere.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.930
So because the divergence of the
field is 0, the extended

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.540
Gauss' theorem tells us
that the two fluxes--

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.645
the flux out of the cube and the
flux out of the sphere--

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:14.300
are actually equal
to each other.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.060
But since the fluxes are
actually equal to each other,

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.840
in order to compute the flux out
of the cube, it's enough

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.270
to compute the flux
out of the sphere.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.580
OK.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.820
But computing the flux out of
the sphere is relatively easy,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.430
because on the sphere,
the integrand F

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.870
dot n is just a constant.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.640
And so then we're integrating a
constant over the surface of

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.290
a sphere, and that just gives
us the surface area of the

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.160
sphere times that constant,
which is 4 pi R squared, times

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.060
1 over R squared,
which is 4 pi.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.220
So the flux out of the cube then
is also equal to 4 pi.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.010
I'll stop there.
