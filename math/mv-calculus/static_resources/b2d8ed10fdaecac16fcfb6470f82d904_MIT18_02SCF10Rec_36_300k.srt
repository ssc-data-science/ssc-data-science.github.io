CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,100
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem:

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,210
So given the region r shown
below, which I'll mention more

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,970
of in a moment, compute the
integral double integral over

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,900
r of the quantity 4x squared
minus y squared to the fourth

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,390
dx dy, and I want you to do it
by changing variables to u is

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,930
equal 2x minus y and v is
equal to 2x plus y.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,120
And the region defined down here
is just these three line

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,450
segments and the intersection of
the region bounded by these

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,490
three line segments.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,180
So one of them is a portion of
the y-axis, one of the them is

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,530
a portion of the line defined
by 2x minus y equals 0, and

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,720
one of them is a portion of
the line defined by 2x

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,690
plus y equals 2.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,150
So why don't you do this, make
sure you use this change of

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,410
variables, and then I'll come
back, and I'll draw the

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,410
accompanying region in the u,
v plane, and then we'll see

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,880
how I set it up.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:20,430

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,720
OK, welcome back.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,980
Well, the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,390
draw the region in the u, v
plane that is determined by

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,090
this region in the x, y plane
and the change of variables.

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,710
Now, as was mentioned in the
lecture, all of the changes

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,010
are linear, and so I'm going to
be taking lines to lines.

26
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,550
So what I'm going to do is
determine at each endpoint

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,570
here where that endpoint goes
under the transformation, and

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,230
then I will connect the dots.

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,980
So what do I get?

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,400
Well, this first one is 0, 0
for x and y, and so that

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,420
corresponds to x and y are 0
here, so u is 0, and x and y

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,300
are 0 here, so it would be a 0,
so that's the point 0, 0 on

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
the u, v plane.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,860
Now, I want to mention something
here is that based

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,460
on how these lines were defined,
this is telling you

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,700
that all along this line 2x
minus y equals 0, that means u

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,640
is equal to 0 all along
that segment.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,550
And if you'll notice also, 2x
plus y is equal to 2 here, so

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,020
v is equal to 2 all along
this segment.

40
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,250
So we should expect whatever u
is, v's going to be 2 here,

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,580
and whatever v is here,
u is going to be 0.

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,220
OK, so I'm going to have
something with u, 0 initially,

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,740
and then v, 2, I can already
expect, it's going to come up

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,290
here and move over that way.

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,570
But let's just check.

46
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,210
So this is the point 0, 2,
0 for x and 2 for y.

47
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's see what it is in
the u, v variables.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,030
So u in that case is negative 2
and v in that case is 2, and

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,340
so I'm going to go
left 2 and up 2.

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,210
This might not be drawn to
scale, but this is negative 2,

51
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,040
and this is up 2 here, and so
that's where this point goes

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
in the transformation.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,560
This point is 1/2 comma 1.

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,460
You can actually check
what it is.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,880
But actually, as I mentioned,
you already know what has to

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,670
happen, because this segment is
connected right here, and

57
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:31,040
then we said all along this
line, v is 2, and all along

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,120
this line, u is 0, and
so that actually

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,290
carves out that rectangle.

60
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,570
So if you were worried and you
weren't able to do it that

61
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,430
way, what you could actually
do is say, well, where does

62
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,170
the point 1/2, 1 go?

63
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,640
If I plug in 1/2 for x and 1 for
y, I notice that I get u

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
equals 0 and v equals 2,
and that's this point.

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,950
And so now, I'm looking
at this region.

66
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,060
Now, these two things are not
drawn to the scale, because

67
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,150
what I want to point out is
they're both triangles.

68
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,160
It's easy to find the area based
on how they're sitting

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,400
in two-dimensional space.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,430
So what we see here is if I
wanted to find the area of

71
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,830
this triangle, let's
make this the base.

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,620
The base is 2 and the height is
1/2, so 1/2 of base times

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,470
height is--

74
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,510
that area is equal to 1/2.

75
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,570
So the area of r is 1/2, and
what's the area of this one?

76
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,650
The area this one is-- well,
I've got base 2 and height 2,

77
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,070
and so it's 1/2 of 2 times
2, and so that

78
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,140
gives me area as 2.

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,230
So here the area is 1/2, here
the area is 2, and so notice

80
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,730
that I've multiplied by 4 to
get from here to here.

81
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,020
So I can anticipate that I
should have-- based on the

82
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,700
principle you saw in lecture,
I should have something like

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,660
du dv is going to be equal
to 4 times dx dy.

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,250
That is what I expect to get.

85
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,580
Now let's see if when we
do the Jacobian, we

86
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,710
get the same thing.

87
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,640
Let me double check, right?

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,920
This is area 2, this is area
1/2, so I have 1/2 times 4 is

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,530
going to give me 2.

90
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,780
Yeah, that's what
I should get.

91
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,310

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,510
Oops!

93
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,100
That sticks out a little.

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,340
So now let's just check our
Jacobian and see if that is

95
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,990
indeed what we get.

96
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,450
So I'm going to look at
u sub x, u sub y, v

97
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,350
sub x, v sub y, right?

98
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,840
So u sub x is 2, u sub y is
negative 1, so I get 2,

99
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,050
negative 1.

100
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,130
v sub x is 2, v sub y
is 1, so I get 2, 1.

101
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,860
2 times 1 is 2 minus negative
2 gives me, indeed, 4.

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,930
So I do get, in fact, du
dv is equal to 4 dx dy.

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,200
So I know that I'm going to have
to-- because I'm changing

104
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,090
variables, though, from dx dy to
du dv, I'm going to divide

105
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,570
by 4, obviously, when I
do the substitution.

106
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,850
The substitution will be
replacing just dx dy.

107
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,070
So I just mention that, but
notice: Again, we get what we

108
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,640
expect to get.

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,190
We got a 4 based on the picture
and we got a 4 based

110
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,950
on the Jacobian.

111
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,420
And so now, we need to finish
up the process.

112
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,530
We need to figure out how to
write this in terms of u and v

113
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,030
and then figure out our bounds
in terms of u and v, and then

114
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,720
we're done.

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
So let me mention, one thing
you should notice is that u

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,930
times v is equal to exactly--

117
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,250
this is going to be a difference
of two squares, and

118
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,410
it is precisely 4x squared
minus y squared.

119
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,300
If you need to multiply it out
to check, you can check it,

120
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,410
but that's indeed what it is,
which is why this particular

121
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,260
substitution is quite nice,
because that means this

122
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,420
function I'm supposed to be
integrating is just uv raised

123
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,030
to the fourth.

124
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,370
So I'm almost done.

125
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,270
So let me write in the pieces I
know, and then we'll fill in

126
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,380
the last two spots, or four
spots, which will be all the

127
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,360
bounds on the integral.

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,300
So I'm going to write it here,
give myself some space to

129
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,960
write the bounds.

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
So I'm replacing the 4x squared
minus y squared by a

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
uv, so I'm going to get u
times v, and then the

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,370
function, that is raised to
the fourth in the initial

133
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,450
problem, so I raise that
to the fourth.

134
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,660
Then dx dy, as I mentioned, will
be replaced by a du dv

135
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,190
divided by 4.

136
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,095
And so I can just put this
over 4 and write du dv. I

137
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,780
should be careful which
order I want to do.

138
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,960
It doesn't really matter.

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,250
I can do either one.

140
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,990
du dv, OK?

141
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,380
And so now I want to know what
u goes from and to and then

142
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,600
what v has to go from and to.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,780
So if I come over here, you'll
see it didn't matter, because

144
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,540
I could have picked either
direction to go.

145
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,210
But if I'm going to go with u,
I'm coming from whatever this

146
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,790
function is over
to here, right?

147
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,330
And this value here is easy.

148
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,930
That's u equals 0.

149
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,560
So the top bound for u is 0,
and the bottom bound for u,

150
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,400
this is v is equal to minus u,
so the bottom bound for u is

151
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,510
when u is equal to negative
v. So I'm running from--

152
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,020
because I put the du on the
inside, my first one is

153
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,140
running from minus v to--
what did I say--

154
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,940
0, and then the v values from
there go between 0 and 2.

155
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,320
You can see this easily
from the picture.

156
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,370
So they go between zero and 2.

157
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,290
And I am not going to finish it
off from here, because it

158
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,480
would require not
too much work.

159
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,430
It's actually quite simple,
because it's just a polynomial

160
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,600
and u and a polynomial and v,
but there are a lot of powers

161
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,300
and there will be
big powers of 2.

162
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,730
So suffice it to say, at this
point, we can evaluate this

163
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,850
integral and it's quite
easy to evaluate.

164
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,380
And the main point I think we
should make is how did it make

165
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,320
it simpler?

166
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,300
I mean, the initial problem, if
we come over here, this is

167
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,250
annoying to find an
anti-derivative, but not

168
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,350
impossible.

169
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,490
But the really annoying part is
I would have to take this

170
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,680
region and split it into a bunch
of pieces, or at least

171
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,100
two pieces, to evaluate the
integral in a reasonable way

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,090
or my y-values would go
from this line here up

173
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,690
to this line here.

174
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,170
It could be complicated.

175
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,260
So what we've really done is
we've simplified the region.

176
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,510
That's the easiest thing.

177
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,870

178
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,100
I mean, we also simplified the
function, but we've really

179
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,350
simplified the region we're
integrating over.

180
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,060
And so we only have one is
a function and one is a

181
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,530
constant, and that's quite nice
to have on the inside.

182
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,880
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
