JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,240
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,600
In lecture, you've learned a
little bit about the dot

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,712
product, and how the dot product
can be used to compute

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:18,060
angles between vectors, or the
relationship between the dot

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,590
product of vectors and the
angle between them.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,870
So, here I have two questions,
two related questions for you.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,860
So the first one, you've
got two vectors.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,250
i hat plus j hat plus 2k hat.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,075
And a second vector, 2i hat
minus j hat plus k hat.

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm probably going to stop
saying the hats in a minute,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,650
just warning you.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,810

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,680
So you've got these two
different vectors, and what

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,340
I'd like to know is what the
angle between them is.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,000
And the second one is that
we have three points.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,760
So the P has coordinates
a, 1, and minus 1.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,890
Q has coordinates 0, 1, and 1.

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,730
And R has coordinates
a, minus 1, and 3.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,940
So when you've given
three points,

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,380
that define some angles.

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,530
So what I'd like to know is for
which values of a is the

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,290
angle PQR a right angle?

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,400
So why don't you take some time,
work out these problems,

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,070
come back, and we can work
them out together.

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:24,710

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,120
Hopefully you had some
luck on these

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,380
problems. Let's get started.

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,220
Let's start with
the first one.

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,610
So we have these two vectors,
i plus j plus 2k, and 2i

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,150
minus j plus k.

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,300
And we want to know what the
measure of the angle

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,410
between them is.

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,660
So the thing that we have to use
here, is that for vectors

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,010
v and w, we know that v dot w
can be written in terms of the

37
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,010
angle between them.

38
00:01:47,010 --> 00:02:02,270
So in particular, we know that
for vectors v and w, if the

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,380
angle between them is equal to
theta, then cosine of theta is

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,360
equal to v dot w, but I have to
divide by the length of v

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,570
and the length of w.

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,860
So I have this simple formula
for cosine of theta in terms

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,770
of v and w.

44
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,010
And so then if we want,
we can find theta by

45
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,550
taking an arc cosine.

46
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,690
So let's apply this formula
in the case of problem a.

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,170
So we could say that v is equal
to i plus j plus 2k, and

48
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,160
w is equal to 2i
minus j plus k.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:54,360
And so what that means is that
in our case, v dot w-- well,

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,720
we just take, you know, the
products of the coordinates

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,500
and add them up.

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,190
So in that case, this is 1 times
2 plus 1 times minus 1

53
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,290
plus 2 times 1.

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:12,740
So this is 1 times 2 plus 1
times minus 1 plus 2 times 1.

55
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,910
So that's 2 minus 1 plus 2,
so that's equal to 3.

56
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,030
And so then we also need to know
what the length of v and

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,550
w are in order to apply
this formula.

58
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,600
So the length of v is equal to,
well it's the square root

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,510
of the sum of the squares
of the coordinates--

60
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,170
or the square root of v dot v.
So in this case, that's the

61
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,860
square root of 1 squared plus
1 squared plus 2 squared.

62
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,150
So that's the square
root of 6.

63
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:51,510
And the length of w is equal to
it's the square root of 2

64
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,600
squared plus minus 1 squared
plus 1 squared, which is also

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,540
equal to the square root of 6.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,540
So if you put these three things
together, we have that

67
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,940
cosine of theta is equal--

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,180
so I'm going to write it right
up here next to this general

69
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,080
formula just to save a
little bit of space--

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,190
so in our case, this is equal
to 3 divided by the square

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,560
root of 6 times the
square root of 6.

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,390
So that's 3 divided by 6,
which is equal to 1/2.

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,810
So if cosine of theta is equal
to 1/2, well we know that that

74
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,150
means that theta is equal
to pi over 3.

75
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,790
OK?

76
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:41,600
So the angle between these
two vectors is pi over 3.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,630
OK, great.

78
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,870
That's part a.

79
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,570
Now let's talk about part b.

80
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,860
So we have these three points
and we want to know for what

81
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,630
values is the angle that they
define a right angle.

82
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,650
For what values of
this parameter.

83
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,870
Right?

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,970
Our points depend on
this parameter, a.

85
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,780
So in order to do that,
we have these

86
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,470
three points in space.

87
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,420
Let me draw a picture up here.

88
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,760
So we have point P somewhere
and point Q somewhere and

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,020
point R somewhere, and they
define this angle, and we want

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,500
to know when this angle
is a right angle.

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,850
Well, we don't have any vectors
yet, but it's easy to

92
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,810
get some vectors involved
in this problem.

93
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,000
We can look at the vectors
QP and QR.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,560
So those two vectors are the two
sides of this angle that

95
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
we're interested in.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,530
And it's easy when you're given
coordinates for points

97
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,520
to find the vector
between them.

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,360
So you just subtract, right?

99
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
So QP.

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,650
In order to get from our point
Q over here-- in order to get

101
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,970
from 0, 1, 1 to a, 1, minus 1--
well, you have to increase

102
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,770
the first coordinate by a, the
second coordinate has to stay

103
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,100
the same, and the third
coordinate has

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,660
to decrease by 2.

105
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:01,000
So this vector QP is equal
to a, 0, minus 2.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,570
So now I'm using
angle brackets,

107
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,055
because this is a vector.

108
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,380
SPEAKER 1: Positive
2 or negative 2?

109
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,630
JOEL LEWIS: Negative 2.

110
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,020

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,770
Yes.

112
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,260
Right.

113
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,160
Negative 2, yeah?

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,230
Because we're going
from 1 to minus 1.

115
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,680
OK, good.

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,390
And similarly QR.

117
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,620
So to get from Q to R--

118
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,580
I have to go back and look at
the coordinates over here-- so

119
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,940
I increase the first coordinate
by a, decrease the

120
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,430
second coordinate by 2, increase
the third coordinate

121
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,229
by 2, to get from Q to R. So the
vector QR is equal to a--

122
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,479
what did I say--

123
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,170

124
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,450
minus 2, 2.

125
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,180
So these are the vectors QP and
QR, and we want to know

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,970
when the angle between these two
things is a right angle.

127
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,880
We want to know when these
vectors are perpendicular.

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
OK?

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,820
So the two vectors are
perpendicular exactly when

130
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,050
their dot product is 0.

131
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,060
Right?

132
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,580
When the angle is 90 degrees.

133
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,860
Cosine of 90 degrees.

134
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,970
Cosine of pi over 2 radians is
equal to 0, so those two

135
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,010
things are the same.

136
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,615
The dot product equals 0 and
the angle is 90 degrees.

137
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,810
So OK.

138
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:28,310
So in our case, we just have
to look then at QP dot QR.

139
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,050
So that's equal to-- well, we
just take this dot product

140
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,800
here-- so it's equal
to a squared plus--

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,350
0 times minus 2 is 0--

142
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,820
minus--

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,600
2 times 2, so plus minus 2 times
2-- so that's minus 4.

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,250
So that's a squared minus 4.

145
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,580
And so this dot product is
equal to 0 exactly when a

146
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,620
squared minus 4 is equal to 0.

147
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,590
So a squared minus 4 is equal
to 0 when a is equal to 2 or

148
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,470
when a is equal to minus 2.

149
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,530
So there are two values of a for
which those three points

150
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,390
form a right angle at Q.

151
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,720
So just to quickly summarize,
we used this general formula

152
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,840
here for the cosine of an angle
in terms of the two

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,560
vectors that are the
sides of the angle.

154
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,660
And with that formula, we can
compute the measure of angles

155
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,820
between two vectors as here--
or, as in the first

156
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,750
part, in part a.

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,900
Or in a special case when we're
looking for a 90 degree

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,460
angle, we can use the simplified
form when we just

159
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,520
need to figure out when the
dot product is equal to 0.

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,140
OK.

161
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,920
So I'll end there.

162
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,457
