00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,550

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,880
In this video I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,720
Which is we begin with a vector
field, capital F, that

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,270
is zxi plus zyj plus xk.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,710
And we're going to look at the
curve C that is a helix, that

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,260
we can describe by
the parameter t.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,310
So we'll describe it as cosine
t comma sine t comma t.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,520
And we're interested in the
portion of the helix that goes

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,240
from (1, 0, 0) to minus
(1, 0, pi).

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,030
And I'd like you to do two
things with this problem.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,200
The first thing I'd like you
to do is I'd like you to

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,250
sketch the curve that is carved
out when you follow the

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,220
t values that will start you at
(1, 0, 0) and will finish

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,580
you up at (minus 1, 0, pi).

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,980
The second thing I would like
you to do is I would like you

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,660
to compute the line integral
F dot dr over that

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,200
portion of the helix.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,270
So there are two parts
to this problem.

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,210
Why don't you pause the video,
work on these two parts, and

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,680
then when you're feeling
comfortable seeing the

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,155
solution, bring the video
back up and I'll show

23
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:10,405
you how I did it.

24
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:18,370

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,410
OK, welcome back.

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,220
So again what we're interested
in doing in this problem is

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,580
first, understanding what the
curve looks like that we want

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,160
to take this line
integral over.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,800
And then actually computing
the line integral.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,230
So we have this C that is a
helix and it's described by

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,810
cosine t, sine t, t.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,780
And in fact, well, I won't say
any more about this helix.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,550
But it actually should remind
you when you see the picture

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,260
of some portion of what
DNA looks like.

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,610
It's going to spiral
around just the way

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,500
some little side of--

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,980
if you take DNA, how it spirals
up, it's going to be

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,800
the boundary of some of that.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,540
So we'll see that momentarily.

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,840
And if you notice, the first
thing that's helpful if you

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
want to sketch the curve,
is that t--

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,300
I know immediately what the
parameters are in t.

43
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,120
t is ranging from 0 to pi.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,940
So I know already exactly
what I want to do.

45
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,340
And in order to draw this curve,
what I'm going to do is

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,090
I'm going to give myself
a frame of reference.

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,840
Because otherwise it's going
to be really hard

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,630
to draw this curve.

49
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,770
And the frame of reference
is the following.

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,570
All of these points, all of the
points cosine t, sine t,

51
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,250
t, lie in the x-y distance
from the origin.

52
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,530
They lie at a radius 1.

53
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,000
So in terms of x and y, they're
all going to sit on

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,610
the boundary of a cylinder
of radius 1.

55
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,310
So let me draw what I mean by
that and then we'll see where

56
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,280
the points are.

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,710
So let me actually come
write right over here.

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,550
So my first part sketching the
curve, the first thing I'm

59
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,810
going to do is give
myself a cylinder.

60
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,840
Which I'll show you is of
radius 1 momentarily.

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,510
And I'm going to actually say
this is the z-axis, coming

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,830
straight through the middle.

63
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,260
And then the y-axis is
going to come out

64
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,830
the side, as usual.

65
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,140
And the x-axis is going to come
down in this direction.

66
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,010
OK, so this cylinder I'm
thinking of, it has radius 1.

67
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,320
So at any given z value, any
fixed z value that I intersect

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,450
with the cylinder gives it
a circle of radius 1.

69
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,810
Now if you notice again, what
I was trying to explain from

70
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,130
over here, is that if I don't
look at the z component,

71
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,790
obviously the cosine t sine t
is something that's on the

72
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,050
unit circle if I ignore
the z component.

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,185
And so that's how I know that
these x and y values here are

74
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,500
just going to lie on the
cylinder, because they're

75
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,180
always distance 1 from the
z-axis at any given height.

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,400
So that's the first
thing I observe.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,330
The second thing I observe is
that I mentioned t goes from 0

78
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,920
to pi, and that's exactly
the z values also.

79
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,210
So the z values are going from
0 to pi, so I know my first

80
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,870
value is going to be
on the x-y plane.

81
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,250
And my last value is going to
be on the z equals pi plane.

82
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,650
And then the last thing to
observe is that what is being

83
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,920
carved out in the x
and y components?

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,390
Well, it's really exactly what
you would do if you were

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,960
trying to parameterize
a circle.

86
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,100
But you're parameterizing a
circle and instead of just

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,130
drawing it always on
the same z plane--

88
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,550
so x-y plane, z equals
a constant--

89
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,040
you're parameterizing
that circle and

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,540
you're also moving up.

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,100
And so the first value
(1, 0, 0) is

92
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,150
happening somewhere here.

93
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,090
And the last value
is happening at

94
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,170
negative (1, 0, pi).

95
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,450
And so I have to go sort of in
the backwards direction.

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,430
So here's my x equals
negative (1, 0, pi).

97
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,880
And so I'm kind of behind.

98
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,850
You should think of this as
being-- let me see if I can

99
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,700
draw this--

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,510
this is behind the pi.

101
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,800
Maybe I should draw it
a little further.

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,540
If this is the pi height, it
was more like right there.

103
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,900
It's behind the z-axis here.

104
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,540
It's on the other side.

105
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,580
And so the curve that's carved
out is going to look

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,410
something like this.

107
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,200
It's going to come
up through here.

108
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,930
It's spiraling.

109
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,470
And then it's going to go behind
on the other side of

110
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,220
the cylinder and spiral up.

111
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,670
Now in a perfect world, if I
could draw this actually in

112
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,570
three dimensions, the way it's
coming up is actually it has

113
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,200
to have some sort of
constant rate.

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,390
Because it's always moving
in the z direction

115
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,640
at a constant rate.

116
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,280
It's moving in the z
direction linearly.

117
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,440
Maybe this picture is not the
most perfect picture because

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,260
it looks like it's going up
really fast at the end.

119
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,040
But it gives us a feel for
how the curve looks.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,730
If I continued it, it would come
back around to the front

121
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,650
by the time t went to 2 pi.

122
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,920
And so this is a spiral.

123
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
It goes around the cylinder,
behind the cylinder.

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,510
And then if I go for another
pi, from pi to 2 pi, it's

125
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,160
going to go--

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,130
continue to curve around and
then come back out to the

127
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,520
front and be right
above this point.

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,780
So that's the helix.

129
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,610
That's the shape of the helix.

130
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,400
So this is an approximate
sketch.

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,110
Good thing I said sketch
the curve.

132
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,880
So this is a sketch
of the curve.

133
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,360
And now what we want to do,
again as I mentioned, is we

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,140
want to compute a line integral,
we want to compute F

135
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,030
dot dr over this curve.

136
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,390
So what I'm going to need is I'm
going to know that this is

137
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,450
the curve here and I need to
understand how to parameterize

138
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,280
F and dr in terms of
this parameter t.

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,350
So that's what I'm
interested in.

140
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,270
So let's think about what F dot
dr is in order to do this.

141
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,180
I think the notation you've
seen from lecture is F we

142
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,685
usually denote by capital P,
capital Q, capital R. And dr

143
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,740
we denote dx, dy, dz.

144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,370

145
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,730
And so F dot dr, as we've
seen previously, is Pdx

146
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,580
plus Qdy plus Rdz.

147
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,560
So let's see what that is in the
parameters we have. So let

148
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,570
me first remind ourselves, x in
this situation is cosine t.

149
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,040
y is sine t.

150
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,490
And z is equal to t.

151
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,400
Based on how we're
parameterizing the curve.

152
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,650
And we're interested
in the values of t

153
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,720
going from 0 to pi.

154
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,510
So these are the quantities
that we're going to need.

155
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,760
Now in order to solve this
problem I need dx, dy, dz.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,350
I also need P, Q, and
R in terms of

157
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,190
these x, y, and z values.

158
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,295
So let me remind you also I'm
going to write it over here so

159
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,190
I don't have to look again.

160
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:40,340
F is actually zx comma
zy comma x.

161
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,410
Let me check that.

162
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, that is what I have. So
that is my F. So now that I

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,940
have it a little closer, I'm
going to put it all together.

164
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,220
And I actually have to move over
to put it together, but

165
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,950
now the reference is closer.

166
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,740
So notice first I'm
going to do P dx.

167
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,550
So P is z times x.

168
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,240
And then what is dx?

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,450
Well, dx--

170
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,470
I really need to figure out what
dx dt is, right? dx dt is

171
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,020
negative sine t.

172
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,940
And so I'm going to replace
the dx by a

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,490
negative sine t dt.

174
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,300
I'll be replacing dy by cosine
t dt and I'll be

175
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,310
replacing dz by dt.

176
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,820
So I have all the pieces
here I just

177
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,670
have to put them together.

178
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,920
So let me do that.

179
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,240

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,080
I want to integrate over C F dot
dr. I'm really going to be

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,070
integrating--

182
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,420
let's see.

183
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,650
Let me come to this side so I
can see everything I need--

184
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm really going to
be integrating.

185
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,710
I know I'm integrating from
0 to pi in my parameter t.

186
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,560
My first component of
F I told you was zx.

187
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,810
So that's t cosine t, and
then dx is, as I said,

188
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,680
negative sine t dt.

189
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,150
So times negative sine t dt.

190
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,920
That's my first component.

191
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,200
My next component, as
I said, is Qdy.

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Q was zy and so it's t sine t.

193
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,540
And then dy is cosine t dt.

194
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,530

195
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,040
Oops, let me put the dt there,
it's a little easier.

196
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,610
And then I'm going to write the
last component here, so we

197
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,300
can see it all in one frame.

198
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
And then the last
thing was r dz.

199
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,080
And r is just x.

200
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,850
So that's cosine t.

201
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,270
And dz is just dt.

202
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,400
So there's three components.

203
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,020
This was the Pdx component, this
is the Qdy component, and

204
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,840
this is the Rdz component.

205
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,390
And so notice, this is great.

206
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,500
This is why I like
this problem,

207
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,220
it's going to be nice.

208
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,450
Because I've got a t cosine t
times negative sine t, and a t

209
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,250
sine t times a cosine t.

210
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,810
And so these two add up to
0 and so I only have to

211
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,080
integrate one thing.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,710
So I only have to integrate
from 0 to pi cosine t dt.

213
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,600

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
And so what do I get?

215
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,720
I get this should be sine
t evaluated at 0 and pi.

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,980
And sine of pi I believe is 0.

217
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,830
And sine of 0 I believe is 0.

218
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,050
And so I get 0 minus
0, so I get 0.

219
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,780
So they're actually--

220
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,580
when I compute the line
integral of F dot

221
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,050
dr over that helix--

222
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,120
I actually get 0.

223
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,380
So let me just remind you real
quick what the point of the

224
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,010
problem was and what we did.

225
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,760
We had at the very beginning a
vector field, we had a curve,

226
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,850
and essentially all we were
doing is a problem we've done

227
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,070
in two dimensions many times,
which is compute a line

228
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,470
integral along a curve.

229
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,330
And so we just added
a dimension.

230
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,910
The problem is exactly
the same.

231
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,250
Instead of now just dx
and dy, now we have a

232
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,750
dx, dy, and a dz.

233
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,400
We have one extra direction
you're moving.

234
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,370
But that's all that's
different.

235
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,260
So the first thing we did
was sketch the curve.

236
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,120
Then we computed the line
integral, as I'm saying, by

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,190
exactly the same methods that
we did in two dimensions.

238
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,530
So everything really should
remind you of what you've done

239
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,750
previously, we now just have
a third component we

240
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,720
have to deal with.

241
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,530
And that was, in our case, in
this problem the Rdz part.

242
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,520
So I think that's
where I'll stop.

243
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,006
