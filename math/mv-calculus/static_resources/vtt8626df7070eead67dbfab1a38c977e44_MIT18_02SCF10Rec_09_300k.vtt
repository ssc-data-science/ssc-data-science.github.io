CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.700
In this video, what I want to
work on is using what we know

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.360
about matrix multiplication
and finding inverses of

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.420
matrices to solve a system
of equations.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.860
So we've set up the system
already as if it's already in

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.690
matrix form.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.550
And what I'd like us to do is,
for this particular A-- this 3

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.820
by 3 matrix A--

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.250
find a vector x, so
that Ax equals b.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.750
Where b is equal to
these two things.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.815
So you're going to
do two problems.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:39.480
You're going to do when b
equals 1, 2, negative 3.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.220
And you're going to do when
b is equal to 0, 0, 0.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
So you want to find vector
x so that Ax

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.050
equals this value here.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.350
And what I'd like you to do
is I'd like you to use the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160
strategy that you saw in the
lecture, which is find A

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.110
inverse, and then take
A inverse b.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.920
So we really want to practice
understanding how to find the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.350
inverse of a matrix.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340
So why don't you work on this,
pause the video, when you feel

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.690
comfortable, confident, that
you have the right answer,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.200
then bring the video back
up, and you can compare

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.450
your work with mine.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.080
OK, welcome back.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.330
Well, hopefully you were able
to make some headway and you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.740
feel confident in your
answers for 1 and 2.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
I am going to find the inverse
of the matrix A first, and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.610
then solve the problem.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850
And because there's a
lot of computation,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.980
I may make a mistake.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.660
So I'm going to have to check
every once in awhile

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.830
that I'm doing OK.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.310
so hopefully-- it's too bad you
can't tell me if I've made

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.020
a mistake, but hopefully
my studio audience

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.260
will help me out.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.360
So the first thing I need to
do is I need to find the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.170
determinant of A. So I'm going
to do that first, and then I'm

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.540
going to find the cofactor
matrix and go from there.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.880
So if I want to find the
determinant of A. I guess I'll

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.860
just use the first row here,
because it's pretty easy.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.020
So the determinant of A is
going to be 3 times the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.170
determinant of this matrix--

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.920
this 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.280
So it's going to be 3 times--

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.830
and then I get a 2 times
negative 1, which is negative

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.750
2, and then minus 0-- so I
get a 3 times negative 2.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.050
Oops.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.010
And I was about to write plus,
but I should write minus.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.970
I take minus 1 times--

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.880
because this is my minus, I take
negative of this thing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.920
times the matrix that is these
two components in the first

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.990
column and these two components

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.290
in the second column.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.580
Right?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.360
We take away the column and
the row that the 1 is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.490
contained in and we look at
what remains-- the 2 by 2

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.460
matrix that remains.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.240
And we find the determinant
of that.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.060
So we get negative 1
times negative 1,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.450
which gives me a 1.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.960
And then negative 1 times
0 gives me a 0.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.470
So I just have the negative 1
from the row 1, column 2 spot,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.080
and then the determinant
of the matrix that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.490
remains is 1, OK--

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.180
of the minor matrix
that remains.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.110
And then the last one I should
put a plus, but notice that it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.590
is a minus already, so I'm
going to put just minus 1

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.170
times what remains.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.990
What's this minor?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.740
This one is this 2 by 2 matrix
I'm looking at, right?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.950
So I need to take the
determinant of this 2 by 2

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.620
matrix and multiply it by that
negative 1 to get the third

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.670
component here I
have to add in.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.130
Negative 1 times negative
1 is 1.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490
And then I subtract negative
1 times 2.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.660
So this is where I have
to be careful.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.990
It's 1 minus negative 2.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.400
So I'm going to get a 3.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.670
OK.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.910
1 here minus a negative
2-- so 1 plus 2--

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.710
I'm going to get a 3.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.480
OK.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.010
And so negative 6 minus
1 minus 3--

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.720
looks like I get
a negative 10.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.040
That's good, because
I think that's what

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.210
I'm supposed to get.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.340
OK.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.460
Now what I want to do is I want
to find the matrix of

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.090
minors for A. And then
I'm going to find--

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.090
so I'm going to find the matrix
of minors first, and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.180
then I'm going to switch the
signs appropriately so I get

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.010
the cofactors correct.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.880
OK?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.710
So some of them I already have.
But, the whole matrix of

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.370
minors, I'm going to just go
through and do it again to be

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.970
very careful.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.960
So the first one I delete.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.910
For the first row and column
spot, I delete row 1 and

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.030
column 1, and I look at the
determinant of that matrix.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.520
That's 2 times negative 1 is
negative 2 minus 0, so I get a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.510
negative 2 there.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.650
For the first row, second column
I come back-- and I'm

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
now again looking, I'm deleting
this column and row--

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.230
and so I'm looking at the
determinant of this matrix.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.890
So I get negative 1 times
negative 1 is 1, minus

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.150
0, so I get a 1.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.900
Again, I'm going to change
all the signs later.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.600
So I'm going to do that
in the second step.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.020
Now I'm in row 1, column 3.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.110
So I'm going to delete row 1,
column 3 and look at the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.970
determinant of that matrix.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.010
I get negative 1 times negative
1 is 1, minus the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.820
negative 2, so there's my 3.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.310
Those I already knew, but I
didn't want to just plop them

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.750
in from here.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.000
But notice that is what
you get here.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.410
Negative 2, 1, and 3.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.570
That's exactly where they
come from, right?

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.920
We got them by the
same method.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.750
OK, and so now I want to find
the minors for the rest of it.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.170
So let's look at, when I delete
row 2, column 1, I'm

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.200
left with 1, negative 1 here.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.390
Negative 1, negative 1 here.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.700
Right?

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.980
So 1 times negative
1 is negative 1.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.830
And then negative and negative
is positive.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.935
So it's negative 1 minus
negative 1, so I

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.200
get negative 2.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.660
That one was a lot of signs,
so you might want to check.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.300
Maybe I should check.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.430
OK, maybe I should check.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.180
I'm deleting this column and
this row, so I get 1 times

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.290
negative 1.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.290
That's a negative 1, right?

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.720
Negative 1 minus--

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.030
negative 1 times negative
1 is 1-- and so there's

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.080
negative 1 minus 1.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.810
That looks good.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.700
Negative 2.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.060
Right?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.800
Negative, negative, negative.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.960
Yeah.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.150
OK.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.270
And then I'm looking
at row 2, column 2.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.130
So now I'm deleting this
row and this column.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.440
All right.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.190
And so I have these sort
of diagonals here.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.150
That's what I'm interested
in, right?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.570
So I get 3 times negative 1.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.100
That's negative 3.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.290
And then minus 1, because I have
negative 1 times negative

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.260
1 is positive 1.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.210
So negative 3 minus 1.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.020
So I should get negative 4.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.480
Right?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.760
And then I'm over here.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.800
So I need to delete this
column and this row.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.010
So I get 3 times negative
1 is negative 3.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.720
Minus the negative
1, that's plus 1.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.340
So negative 3 plus
1 is negative 2.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.450
And before I go on, I'm going
to check those first 2 rows.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.950
Because if I made a mistake
now, it's only

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.990
going to get worse.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.730
What did I have?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.420
Yes.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.690
OK.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.930
So far so good.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.750
Whew.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.520
All right.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.210
Next, final row.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:04.800
OK, final row is, I'm going to
delete this column and row

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.470
here, and I'm looking
at this matrix.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.720
1 times 0 is 0.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.160
2 times negative 1 is negative
1, but I subtract that.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.730
So it's 0 minus negative
2, so it's 2.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.790
And then row 3, column 2.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.300
So row 3, I delete row
3 and column 2.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.090
3 times 0 is 0.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.740
0 minus--

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.340
negative 1 times negative 1 is
1-- so 0 minus 1, that's

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.730
negative 1.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.690
And then the last spot,
I'm deleting this

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.310
row and this column.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.740
So 3 times 2 is 6 minus
negative 1.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.280
I get 7.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.960
All right, let's
check that row.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.080
2, negative 1, 7.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.490
OK.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.530
I have not done the cofactor
matrix yet, because now I need

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.530
to change the appropriate
signs.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.330
OK, so if this is the matrix of
minors, then if I want to

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.060
change it to the cofactor
matrix, what do I have to do?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.190
I'm going to scratch this out
and write the cofactor matrix

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.230
so that we can just change
the signs appropriately.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.560
I'm going to do it
all right here.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.570
And how does it work?

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.450
Well, remember I'm going to
go plus, minus, plus.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.940
Minus, plus, minus.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.830
Plus, minus, plus.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.960
I have to do this grid that
starts with plus and

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
alternates minus.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.190
So this sign stays the same,
this sign switches, this sign

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.090
stays the same.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.630
That's the plus, minus, plus.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.200
This one is going to be
minus, plus, minus.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.690
So the minus switches that.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.490
Plus keeps that the same.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.430
Minus switches that.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.010
And then I was at minus,
plus, minus.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.300
So I'm going to have
plus, minus, plus.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.690
And so these two stay the same,
and this one switches.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.404
So a lot of things that were
negative became positive.

00:08:36.404 --> 00:08:38.650
And I had to change--

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.090
maybe I threw in one negative,
maybe not.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.720
But, so out all the signs I
kept, this one stayed the

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.550
same, this one stayed the same,
this one stayed the

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.140
same, these two stayed the
same, and then these 4

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.010
switched, because it's the plus,
minus, plus sort of grid

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.980
that I have to put
on top of this.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.870
OK, so that's the
cofactor matrix.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.620
We're getting closer.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.830
OK, now we need the transpose
of this, right?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.025
So if I look at the transpose,
actually, know what I'm going

00:09:09.025 --> 00:09:12.070
to do-- because I'm also just
going to have to take the

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.330
transpose and then multiply it
by 1 over the determinant--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.190
I'm going to do that
all at once.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.980
OK.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.380
Because we can do that all at
once, and then we don't have

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.750
to worry about it.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.560
So A inverse I know is going to
be negative 1/10, because

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.720
the determinant was minus 10.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.130
So it's 1 over the determinant
times the

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.790
transpose of this matrix.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.544
So the transpose of this
matrix-- remember what I'm

00:09:34.544 --> 00:09:37.650
going to do is essentially you
fix the diagonal and you're

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.000
going to flip.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.220
That's really what, in the
square matrix, that's how you

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.230
can think about it.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.310
But every column is going
to become a row.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.620
So I'm going to write this
as my first row.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.500
This first column is going
to become my first row.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.810
So it's going to be negative
2, 2, 2 as my first row.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.720
And then the next column is
going to be negative 1,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.670
negative 4, 1.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.010
I mean next row.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.930
I will take a column and
change it to a row.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.220
The next row is going to be
negative 1, negative 4, 1.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.360
And then the last one.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.620
I take this column and
I change it to a row.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.970
It's going to be 3, 2, 7.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.780
OK.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.530
And because again, I want
to make sure-- this

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.220
one is really messy--

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.550
I want to make sure I have
something similar for that, or

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.800
exactly that.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.530
OK.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.850
I think I'm still
doing all right.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.670
Now, let's get to solving
the problem.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.920
Because so far, we just were
finding the inverse matrix.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.860
So I'm going to leave it in this
form, instead of dividing

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.290
by 10 in every spot, because
that will be annoying.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.870
So let's think about how do I
want to solve the system.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.990
That I had, I had Ax equals b.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.470
And actually, I mean, my
strategy is to find the

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.770
inverse matrix.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.300
I didn't talk to you about why
we know the inverse matrix

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.150
actually exists.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.540
But ultimately, you haven't
even seen this yet in the

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.450
lecture videos, really.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.690
Except that you know that the
determinant of A being

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.790
non-zero gives you an
inverse matrix.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.750
That's all you know, I
think, at this point.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.360
That you have the determinant
of A. It's non-zero, so you

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.100
can find an inverse matrix.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.290
Makes sense based on the
formulation you have, because

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.300
if the determinant is 0, then
this quantity 1 over the

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.590
determinant of A, you've run
into quite a bit of trouble.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.920
So that's just as a little
sidebar, we know the inverse

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.960
matrix exists for A.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.340
So what we do--

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.470
this is again the strategy--

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.370
you multiply A inverse A times
x on the left side.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.480
Ooh.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.000
Is equal to-- sorry-- that
should be the lowercase b.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.370
Should be a vector there.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.800
It is equal to A inverse b
on the right hand side.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.880
And you notice, it's very
important, in the matrix

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.780
multiplication video we saw that
it's very important the

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.700
order in which you multiply
matrices.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.120
And since I'm putting A inverse
on the far left of

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.940
this side of the equality, I
have to put it on the far left

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.620
of the right hand side
of the equality.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:58.960
Right?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.190
And in fact, you would run into
trouble if you tried to

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.430
switch the order of these.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.760
OK?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.250
We wouldn't be able
to multiply them.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.000
All right?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So A inverse A, we know is
just the identity matrix.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.620
So you get the identity matrix
times x is equal

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.430
to A inverse b.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:22.640
So you can find x by finding
A inverse times b.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.470
Right?

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.140
And so now we have A inverse.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.860
Let's see if we can
solve the problem.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.830
One point I want to
make is that now

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.080
that you have A inverse--

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.440
I've tried to ask you to
solve the problem for

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.160
two different b's--

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.320
you don't have to go and find
A inverse again, right?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320
You're done finding A inverse.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.130
You just now have to do
the multiplication.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.660
So now for number 1, we
had b was equal to--

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.030
I'm going to write it here,
so I don't have to

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.070
keep looking over--

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.120
1, 2, negative 3.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.040
So A inverse b is going to be
equal to-- well I should get

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.860
another vector, so I
should just have

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.610
three components here.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.200
And I'm probably going to have
to write out what I get,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.370
because it might be long.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.570
But let's see-- actually, you
know what I'm going to do to

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.050
make it easier?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.620
Because there's a lot of
junk going on here.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.510
So what I'm going to do to
make it easier is put the

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.340
negative 1/10 in
front to start.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.740
Because that negative 1/10 is
going to come along with every

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.800
term, so I'm just going to put
the negative 1/10 in front and

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.290
deal with it at the end.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.540
OK?

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.020
So now I'm just going to
multiply b-- which is this 1,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.260
2, negative 3--

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.860
by this big matrix
here without the

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.480
negative 1/10 in front.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.510
OK?

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.320
So let's look at that.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.190
We're just going to have first
row times the column, and

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.020
that's going to give me
the first position.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.115
So negative 2 times
1 is negative 2.

00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:42.030
I'm going to write
them all down.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.350
Plus 2 times 2 is 4.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.300
Plus 2 times negative
3 is negative 6.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.730
So that's the first position.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.920
We'll simplify in a moment.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.180
So the next one, I get
negative 1 times 1.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.490
That's negative 1.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.450
Then I get negative 4 times 2.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.550
That's negative 8.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.190
So minus 8.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.080
And then I get 1 times negative
3, so minus 3.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.750
So we've got two of
the rows done.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.940
We just have to simplify
them in a moment.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.360
And now we just do this
third component.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.080
So it's the third row of A
inverse without that scalar in

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.010
front, times the only
column of b to

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.810
give me the last position.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.450
Right?

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.460
So 3 times 1 is 3, plus 2 times
2 is 4, so I get 3 plus

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.250
4, and then 7 times negative
3 is minus 21.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.090
OK.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.940
So what do I get when
I write it all out?

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.500
I get negative 1/10.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.380
And then--

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.750
so negative 8 plus 4-- that
looks like a minus 4.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.660
Right?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.210
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.170
That looks like a negative 12.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.310
It's a lot of adding for me.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.820
I make a lot of adding
mistakes, so

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.950
we should be careful.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.170
This looks like negative 14.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.030
OK.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.600
So this is a matrix that, it's
just a vector, right?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.040
All the negative signs
will drop out.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.750
I'll get some fractions.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.370
But if it is the correct
answer-- which I'm really

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.510
hoping it is, because I just did
this whole problem and I

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.340
hope it's the correct answer--
if it's the correct answer,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.640
then what should it do?

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.760
When I take the original A that
I had and I multiply it

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.020
by this, I should get b.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.870
I should get 1, 2, negative 3.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.670
So you can check your
work very easily

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.910
to see if it works.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.350
You can take A times this,
and see if you get b.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.340
Right?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.740
And then you'll know if this is
the x we were looking for.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.090
OK?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.550
And then let's look
at number two.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.260
I just said that b
equals 0, 0, 0.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.499
And the point I want to make
there is that since this has

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:45.230
an inverse, A inverse, since A
has an inverse, A inverse b is

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.370
going to be--

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.960
in this case--

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.860
A inverse times 0, 0, 0, which
is going to give you 0, 0, 0.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.280
So the only solution we
have in this case--

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.080
because A inverse, if I look and
I try and multiply every

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.220
row by this column, right, I'm
going to get 0 in the first

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.060
spot, 0 in the second spot,
and 0 in the third spot--

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.910
so the solution I get--

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.940
the x I'm looking for, so
that Ax equals 0, 0, 0--

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.760
is 0, 0, 0.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.810
And what I just want to mention
to you, is that that

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.390
is true because A
is invertible.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.260
If A were not invertible, you
could get other solutions.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.230
Other things might work.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.630
And that's also true, actually,
in this case as

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.860
well, but it's a little harder
to see that it could be

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.480
potentially a weird thing.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:39.550
To solve Ax equals 0, 0, 0, it's
sort of like, naturally

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.380
we see 0, 0, 0 as a solution.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.090
Right away you can see that,
and that's one that we get.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.050
The point I want to make is
because A is invertible,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.620
that's the only solution.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.890
And if A were not invertible,
you could get other

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.260
solutions to that.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.920
So that's something that we
haven't seen yet-- we haven't

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.780
dealt with yet--

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.140
but that is something
that can happen.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.940
So I just want to point out that
there could be an oddity

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.490
if A were not invertible.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.150
But since A is invertible, we
get just one solution for both

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.470
of these things.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.740
OK.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.120
So I'm going to go back and
just remind you of a few

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.470
things of how we found
the inverse matrix,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.210
and then I will stop.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.340
So we were given a matrix A. And
to go through the steps of

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.570
finding the inverse matrix,
what did we do?

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.900
The first thing we did was
we found the determinant.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.690
Then we found the matrix
of minors.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.810
And then I just took that matrix
of minors, put the plus

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.980
minus grid on top of
it so that I got

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.410
the cofactor matrix.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.650
Right?

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.850
And then once I had the cofactor
matrix, you just have

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.580
to transpose it.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.350
So I came over here.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.220
I transposed that, and
I put 1 over the

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.260
determinant of A in front.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.160
So the scalar is 1 over the
determinant of A times the

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.190
transpose of the cofactor
matrix.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.180
And that's what gives
me A inverse.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.710
So there are a fair number of
steps, but you can do them

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.160
very systematically, and then
you have the inverse matrix

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.300
that you're looking for.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.220
And then you can solve for x
when you're looking for Ax

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.030
equals b, and you know b and
you know A. And you do this

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.010
same process we just outlined
here again, and

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.590
that gives it to you.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.620
OK, I think I'll stop there.
