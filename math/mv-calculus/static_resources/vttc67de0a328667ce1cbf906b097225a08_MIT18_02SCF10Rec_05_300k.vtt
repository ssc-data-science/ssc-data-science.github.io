DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.290
As a warm up, let's get started
by computing some

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.170
determinants for 2 by 2
and 3 by 3 matrices.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.190
Why don't you take some time to
work on computing these two

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.540
determinants, and when you're
finished, check back with me

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.960
and I'll show you
how I solved it.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.690
Welcome back.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.390
So why don't we get started with
the 2 by 2 matrix first.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.360
So remember, when we compute
a 2 by 2 determinant, we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.410
multiply the entries in the main
diagonal and we subtract

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.270
from that the product of the
entries in the off diagonal.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:01:02.650
So in this case, we have 3 times
minus 2, minus, minus 4

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.310
times minus 1.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.250
So we have minus 6 minus
4 is minus 10.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.220
OK, now, the 3 by 3 matrix,
we're going to use a Laplace

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.810
expansion, which means that
we're going to need to choose

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.370
a row or a column
in the matrix.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.680
We can choose any row or column,
but as I look at this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190
matrix, I'd like to choose the
first row, because I see this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.200
0 here, which is going to mean
we have less work to do.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.940
So let's do Laplace expansion
across the first row.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.560
So what that means is we take
the very first entry, minus 1,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.980
and now we need to multiply it
by a 2 by 2 determinant, which

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.640
we get by covering up the row
and the column corresponding

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.900
to our first entry.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.110
So our first entry was minus 1,
and what we need to do is

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.340
cover up the row and column
containing that, and we have

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.090
this little 2 by
2 matrix here.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.160
And so we get 2,
2, minus 2, 1.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.770
OK.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.010
The next entry, we have to take
negative of this entry,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.490
but this entry is 0.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.940
So minus 0 times--

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.360
just for practice, why
don't I put in this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.000
cofactor here anyways.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.250
So again, we cover up the row
and the column containing the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.920
0, and we have this
matrix 1, 2, 3, 1.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.950
Now finally, we have to walk
over here, and we have to take

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.320
4 times the minor--

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.800
which we get by covering
up the row and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.050
column containing 4--

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.670
1, 2, 3, minus 2.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.550
And now notice that these are
just 2 by 2 determinants and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.470
we can just compute those the
same way we did earlier.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:30.160
Altogether, we get minus 1,
times 2 minus another 2--

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.180
excuse me--

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.130
2 minus, 2 minus a negative
4, so we get 6.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.750
OK, this one goes away.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.630
And then we have plus 4, times,
we have minus 2 minus

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.260
another 6, so it looks
to me like minus 8.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.920
Altogether, we have minus 38.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.530
Now let's just take a moment
to see what we did

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.410
on the 3 by 3 matrix.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.150
We needed to do a Laplace
expansion, which means that we

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.720
needed to choose a
row or a column.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.220
And we needed to take the
entries of the row and add

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.490
these up, multiplied by the
cofactor matrix we got by

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.820
covering up the row and
column containing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.330
our highlighted entry.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.740
And we needed to do that
alternating the signs.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.860
So we got minus 1 times this
cofactor, minus 0 times this

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.240
cofactor, and then finally, plus
4 times this cofactor.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.790
Altogether, we got minus 38.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.300
OK, I'll leave it at that.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.740
Thank you.
