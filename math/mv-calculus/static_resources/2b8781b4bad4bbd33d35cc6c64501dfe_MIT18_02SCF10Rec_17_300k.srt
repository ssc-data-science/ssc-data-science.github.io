DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,350
In this problem, what I'd like
us to do is I'd like us to

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,180
sketch the graphs in three
dimensions of these functions

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,370
so z here is a function
of x and y.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,210
On this second one, z is also
a function of x and y.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,060
It just happens not
to depend on y.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,660
When you graph these, I'd
suggest to consider slices, so

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,660
what happens if you consider
x equals 0 or if you

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,320
consider z equals 0.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,290
As you graph these, let's
see what you can do.

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,950
So why don't you pause the
video, and I'll check back

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,510
with you in a moment,
and I can show you

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,760
how I solved these.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,720

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,790
OK, welcome back.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,385
So why don't we start by looking
at this function: z is

17
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:59,410
the square root of x squared
plus y squared.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:17,710

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,360
OK, I'll try to always draw my
axes in the same way as we do

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,890
in lecture.

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,340
So x is pointing towards us,
y to the right, and z up.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,360
So as I suggested, I think a
nice way to get started with

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,190
these problems is to just try
setting the variables x and y

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,800
variously equal to 0,
and then seeing--

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,220
instead of a surface in that
case, then we'll get a curve,

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,920
and we'll see what
curve we get.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:51,510
So for instance, if we set x
equals to 0, then we just get

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:59,580
z is the square root of y
squared, so we just get that z

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,610
is the absolute value of y.

30
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,880
So what that means is that
whatever this surface looks

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,070
like, we know what it looks
like if we slice it in the

32
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,170
blackboard, in the plane
of the blackboard.

33
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,880
We know that it just
looks like--

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,730
this is just the graph of the
function absolute value of y,

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,500
z equals absolute value of y.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,220
So now, if you think about it,
what I just said works just as

37
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,750
well for x instead of for y.

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,180
So if we were to graph this in
the xz-plane where we set y

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,190
equals to 0, then
we would get--

40
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,780
OK, I'm going to try
to draw this.

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,150

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,260
So let me draw that
in blue, actually.

43
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:48,240
So the blue is in the
xz-plane and the

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,400
white is in the yz-plane.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,560
OK, now I think what's going to
be really illustrative is

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,380
if we think about what happens
as we fix values of z.

47
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,710
Well, obviously, if we set z
equals to 0, then there's just

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,800
one solution, which is
this point here.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,130
But what's going to be
interesting is if we set z to

50
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,050
be some positive value.

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,940
So, for instance, let's
take z to be 2.

52
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:28,410
So, for instance, we set z
equals 2, then we get 2 equals

53
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,720
the square root of x squared
plus y squared.

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,210
Solving this, this is the same
as saying x squared plus y

55
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,890
squared equals 4.

56
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,930
So what that tells us is that
at the height z equals 2,

57
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,270
we're just going to have
a circle of radius 2.

58
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,180
This is just the equation for
a circle of radius 2, and so

59
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,480
at height 2, we just
have a circle.

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,150
And actually, as you can
see, there's nothing

61
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,340
special about 2.

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,990
At every height, we're just
going to have a circle, and so

63
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,647
this is what's called a cone.

64
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:01,897
OK.

65
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:05,250

66
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:12,560
Now for b, we can expect when
we go over here to b that

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
something funny is going to
happen because it doesn't

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,180
depend on y.

69
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,020
So let's see if we can see how
the fact that z doesn't depend

70
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,490
on y, how this enters
into our picture.

71
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,760
So I'll just walk over
here, and we'll

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,365
consider z equals x squared.

73
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,615
OK.

74
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:34,648

75
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:42,810
So again, we have our x-axis,
x, y, and z axes.

76
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,100
Now, let's consider what this
looks like when we intersect

77
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,470
with the xz-plane, so when
we set y equals to 0.

78
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,690
Well, setting y equal to 0
actually doesn't change the

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,770
equation, and we get
z equals x squared.

80
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,740
So we know what that
looks like.

81
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,990
It's a parabola.

82
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,820

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,630
And this parabola, I want you to
think that it's, you know,

84
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,180
coming out at us, so it's in the
xz-plane, going in and out

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,480
of the board.

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,220
But now if you think about it,
what it means to say that this

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,520
function doesn't depend on y,
what that means is that we

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,800
have the exact same picture
at every value of y.

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,620
So if we go out here,
then we're going to

90
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,670
have the same picture.

91
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,250
And if we go over here,
we're going to

92
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,070
have the same picture.

93
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,980
And, in fact, what you're going
to get is you're going

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,230
to get a prism.

95
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,490

96
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,440
Oh, that's really
hard to read.

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,690
Let's see if we can--

98
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,920

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,380
so let me-- since that's a bit
hard to read on the axes,

100
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
let's draw this again.

101
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,190
What we'll get is we're going
to have a prism, which looks

102
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:03,340
like a parabola, looks like a
sheet that's just stretched

103
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,090
out in the shape
of a parabola.

104
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:13,980
And so, this we could call
a prism of a parabola.

105
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,780

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,280
Now let's see if we can get any
more insight from these

107
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
two pictures.

108
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,110
So look what happened
in this instance.

109
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,140
So here, the function z, it
obviously didn't depend on y.

110
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,126
And we can see that by looking
at the graph, because, you

111
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:39,030
know, as you vary y, the picture
had to be unchanged.

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,090

113
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,730
So the fact that this was a
prism in y and the fact that

114
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,160
the function didn't depend on
y are one and the same fact.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,175
Now if we go over
to the cone--

116
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:57,820
OK, so here, our function
z very much depended

117
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,300
on both x and y.

118
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,380
But you notice that it depended
on x and y only in

119
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,590
the sense--

120
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:13,130
so z is actually equal just to
the radius r, which is x

121
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,990
squared plus y squared.

122
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,380
So the fact that this cone--

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,905
thank you-- the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

124
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,670

125
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,660
So the fact that this only
depends on the radius and not

126
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,080
the relative angle of x and y
is why we got what-- this is

127
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,220
an example of a surface
of revolution.

128
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,310
So we can always expect that if
the dependence of z on the

129
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,290
variables x and y, if you can
actually just rewrite that as

130
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,060
a dependence on r, then you'll
get this nice radial symmetry,

131
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,120
just like we had translational
symmetry for the prism.

132
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,530
And I think I'll leave
it at that.

133
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:51,671
