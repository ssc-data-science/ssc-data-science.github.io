00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.800
What I'd like us to do in
these two problems is to

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.250
understand how to compute the
flux in three dimensions-- the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.980
flux of a vector in
three dimensions--

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.070
across a surface, without
maybe doing a lot of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.830
calculations.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.060
So we're going to see if we can
figure out how to do these

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.930
problems without doing
a lot of computation.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.630
So the first one is to find
the flux of the vector k

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.480
through the infinite cylinder
x squared plus y

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.430
squared equals 1.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.800
So notice this doesn't depend
on z, but in fact at every

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.940
height it is a unit circle.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700
So it's an infinite cylinder.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.680
And then the second problem I'd
like you to think about

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.810
and to try is to to find the
flux of the vector j through

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.050
one square that has side length
1 in the x-z plane.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.150
So you pick any square in the
x-z plane of side length 1 and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.760
find the flux of j through
that square.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.615
And so I think that that's
enough information.

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:03.850
So why don't you try both of
those problems, pause the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.260
video, and then when you're
ready to see my explanation of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.000
how they work, bring
the video back up.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.170
OK, welcome back.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.830
Again, what we're trying to do
is to understand the flux of a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.720
vector field across a surface.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.710
And we're hoping to do it
with the least amount of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.540
calculation possible for these
particular problems. So

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.260
obviously it's going to be
helpful if you can draw a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.750
picture to draw a picture.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.330
So I'm going to draw the surface
that is the infinite

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.420
cylinder first and then I'm
going to look at the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.690
vector field k.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.320
So let me draw my picture
first. If these are my

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.200
coordinate axes, I get--

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.320
I think you have something
usually like this.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
This is x, this is
y, and this is z.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.260
This is how you do them
in your class.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.100
And so it's not going to be a
great picture but I'm going to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.290
try and make it look like a
cylinder up here coming down.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.650
So this is in fact going to be
infinitely long, going down

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.490
forever, but I'll stop it
somewhere down here.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.490
And then so every slice in the
z at a fixed height for z is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.980
going to be a circle.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
I should think about these are
intersecting the x and y axes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.350
at (1, 0) and (0, 1).

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.410
So there's actually a sort of
unit circle down here as well.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.510
Now that's the surface.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.990
Now what does the vector
field look like?

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.150
Well, in general what does the
vector field look like? k is

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.190
just a constant vector field
that points in this direction.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920
This is k.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.740
So k at every point on the
surface is just the vector

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.190
that's pointing straight
up in this direction.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.440
And the normal to the surface,
if you think about it, the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.640
normal to the surface
is independent of z.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.140
It doesn't depend on z at all.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.390
It is always going to be a
vector that is in the x-y

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.050
direction only.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.020
It's going to be--

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.480
essentially at every point it's
going to be sitting in

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.260
the plane z equals
the constant.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.240
Because if you think about what
you have, you have a unit

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.010
circle at every height.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.250
And it doesn't vary in the z
direction at all, with the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.410
bending of that unit circle.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.870
So in fact the normal is always
going to point straight

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.590
out from the unit circle.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.570
There's going to be
no z component.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.420
Or I should say the
z component's 0.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.180
Maybe that's the best
way to say it.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.980
So that means that the
normal dotted with k

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.430
is going to be 0.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.700
And so the answer to the first
question is the flux of k

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.280
through the infinite cylinder
is actually 0.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.790
So the answer to part a is 0.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.960
Been getting a lot of zeroes
in my video so far.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.290
The next one is to find the flux
of the vector j through

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.360
one square in the x-z plane
where the squares

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.470
have side length 1.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.490
So I can draw any
square I want.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.900
That seems to imply that maybe
it'll be the same answer

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.260
everywhere.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.170
So let's see what we get.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.270
Let me draw a picture
for part b.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.520
Label this first maybe.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.530
Let me label my axes.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.360
And I'm going to draw the
simplest one I can.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.100
That does not look like
a square but I'm

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.790
not great at this.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.040
There we go.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.150
So this is my surface sitting
in the x-z plane.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.180
This side length is 1 and
this side length is 1.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.490
So what is the normal
to that surface?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.900
Well, we have two choices and
so we will actually have a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.780
possibility of two answers.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.010
So let me point out that the
normal to the surface-- well,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.410
what direction does
it point in?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.630
Because this plane is in the x-z
plane, the normal to the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.180
surface is either j
or it's minus j.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.300
And so if I'm integrating j
dotted with the normal over

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.710
the surface--

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.305
I'll just call this surface
capital R--

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:56.910
if I'm integrating over R j
dotted with the normal dS, j

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.060
dotted with the normal
is going to be

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.030
either 1 or minus 1.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.330
And hopefully that makes
sense because j--

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.810
let me draw this--
j is pointing

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.460
exactly in the y direction.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.150
And the normal is either in
this direction or in the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.330
opposite direction.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.300
Up to how I choose to
orient the surface.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.590
And so j dotted with n is either
plus or minus 1, and so

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.660
I just get the area of R with
a plus or minus-- ooh, that

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.830
doesn't look like a plus
or minus-- with a

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.080
plus or minus in front.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.060
Depending on whether j dotted
with n is 1 or whether j

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.510
dotted with n is minus 1.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.080
So the solution for this
computation is just the area

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.580
of R or minus the area
of R. Well, what's

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.750
the area of the region?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.410
The area, it's a square
of side length 1,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.790
so it has area 1.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.020
So the final answer is
just plus or minus 1.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.720
So again, let me remind you
what we're trying to do.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.760
We're trying to determine these
fluxes of vector fields

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.600
across surfaces without doing
a lot of calculation.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.520
And in the first case we had a
vector field that pointed in

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.590
the z direction only, and
the normal was only

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.150
in the x and y direction.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.940
And so the flux was 0, even
though it was a vector field

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.720
on an infinite cylinder,
the flux was still 0.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.830
And in the other case, I had
actually here, I had a surface

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.060
that was exactly in
the x-z plane.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.080
And so its normal was exactly
either in the same direction

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.450
as j or 180 degrees
around from j.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.860
So j dotted with the normal was
either plus or minus 1.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.440
And so I only had to know
the area of the region.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.130
Which is why it didn't
matter where I

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.980
moved this unit square.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.930
I didn't tell you where the
unit square had to sit so

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.670
that's where you can see
why it didn't matter.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.820
Because it's just the area.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.120
OK, I think that's
where I'll stop.
