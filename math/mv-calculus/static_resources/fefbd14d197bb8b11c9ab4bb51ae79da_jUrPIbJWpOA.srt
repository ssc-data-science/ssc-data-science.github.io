CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,220
In this video I would like
us to use Green's theorem

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,140
to compute the
following integral,

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,790
where it's the integral
over the curve C,

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,140
where C is the
circle drawn here.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,020
So the circle is oriented so
the interior is on the left

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,320
and it's centered at the point
where x equals a, y equals 0.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,620
So the integral-- you can read
it but I will read it also

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,320
for you-- it's the integral of 3
x squared y squared dx plus 2 x

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,340
squared times the
quantity 1 plus x*y dy.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,090
So you are supposed
to use Green's theorem

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,180
to compute that.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,989
And why don't you
pause the video,

14
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,530
give it a shot, and then when
you're ready to see my solution

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,863
you can bring the video back up.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,040
OK, welcome back.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,050
Well, what we're
going to do, obviously

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,370
to use Green's theorem
to compute this--

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,690
because I gave you a big
hint that you're supposed

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,160
to use Green's
theorem, because we

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,990
have an integral
over a closed curve.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,580
And what we're
going to do is now

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,250
take the integral of another
certain integrand-- obviously

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,080
related in some way to
this-- over the region

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,000
that I will shade here.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
So we're interested in
this shaded region now.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,075
So let me write down what
Green's theorem is and then

28
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,450
we'll put in the
important parts.

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,050
OK, so just to remind you, I'm
not going to write down all

30
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,010
the hypotheses of Green's
theorem that we need,

31
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,770
but the point that I want
to make is that if we start

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:41,800
the integral over this closed
curve C of M*dx plus N*dy we

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,290
can also integrate over the
region that C encloses of N sub

34
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,660
x minus M sub y dy dx.

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,500
So that is ultimately
what we're going to do.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,400
And so in this case
again, as always,

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,470
M is going to be the function
associated with the dx portion.

38
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,270
It's the i-th component
of the vector field.

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,970
And N is going to be the
function associated here

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,880
with the dy.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,830
That's standard obviously.

42
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,455
So now what we want
to do is transform

43
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:18,746
what we have there into
something that looks like this.

44
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:20,810
So the region-- I'm just
going to keep calling it

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,570
R for the moment-- but the
region R, you'll notice,

46
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,790
is the thing that I
shaded in the drawing.

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,420
And so now let's compute
what this is-- well

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,110
you have the
capacity to do that.

49
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,090
That's just some straight
taking derivative.

50
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,677
So I'm just going to write down
what it is and not show you

51
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:39,760
all the individual pieces.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,727
So I'll just write
down what you get

53
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,060
and then the simplified version.

54
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,120
So you get 6 x squared
y plus 4x is N sub x.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,080
And then M sub y is
negative 6 x squared y.

56
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,360
And I'm going to call dy*dx, I'm
just going to refer to it now

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,510
as dA, because that makes
it a lot easier to write.

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,735
Oh, I guess I should call this--
well, dA, this is the area.

59
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,460
The volume form there.

60
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:13,440
So this simplifies and I
just get the integral of 4x

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,590
over this region dA.

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,760
Now this-- you saw
an example of this

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,220
in lecture of how to deal
with these types of problems.

64
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,470
At this point, if
I really wanted to,

65
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,675
I could figure out what the
bounds are in that region

66
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,420
R in terms of x and y, and
I could do a lot of work

67
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,380
and integrate it all, or I
could remember one simple fact.

68
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,820
Which is that if
I have-- I think

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,140
you see it in class as x
bar-- the center of mass

70
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,770
should be equal to
1 over the volume

71
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:57,887
of the region times the integral
of x dA over the region.

72
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:58,720
That's what we know.

73
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,803
This should be-- this maybe
doesn't look like a V.

74
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:03,330
But so in this case,
volume is area, isn't it?

75
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,720
Maybe I should write area,
that might make you nervous.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,635
So if I take the area--
I could just say A of R--

77
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,240
if I take the area,
1 over the area,

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,200
and then I multiply by the
integral of x over R with

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,040
dy*dx, with respect to dA,
then I get the center of mass.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,150
Well, let's look at what--
in this picture, what

81
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,380
is the center of mass here?

82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,670
If I want to balance this
thing on a pencil tip,

83
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,157
if I want to balance this
disc-- assuming the density is

84
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:33,740
everywhere the same--
on a pencil tip,

85
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,660
where am I going
to put the pencil?

86
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm going to put it
right at the center.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,330
The x-value there is a,
the y-value there is 0.

88
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,970
So if I had the y center
of mass, I would want 0.

89
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,750
But I want the x center
of mass, so I want a.

90
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,540
This x bar is actually
equal to, from the picture,

91
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,720
is equal to a.

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,380
And now let's notice
what I've done.

93
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,420
I have taken-- I had
this quantity here-- I've

94
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,230
taken this quantity
except for the 4

95
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,320
and I have a way of
writing explicitly

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,200
what this quantity
is without actually

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
doing any of the integration.

98
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,540
I haven't done any sophisticated
things at this point

99
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,030
except know what the
center of mass is.

100
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,310
So also what is the
area of the region?

101
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm going to need that.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,730
The area of the region--
it's a circle of radius a.

103
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,840
So the area is pi a squared.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,810
So this quantity
is pi a squared.

105
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,870
And all this together tells me
that the integral of x over R

106
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,690
dA, if I solve for this part,
I get a times pi a squared.

107
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,650
So I get pi a cubed.

108
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,000
And that only differs from
our answer by one thing.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,785
There's a scalar--
you multiply by 4

110
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:49,270
and that gives us what we want.

111
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,561
I said differs from our answer.

112
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,510
Differs from what we
want by one thing.

113
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,710
We just multiplied by 4 there,
so we multiply by 4 here.

114
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,360
So in fact-- maybe there looks
like there was a little magic

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,740
here, so let me point out some
of the key points at the end.

116
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,270
I started off knowing I
was trying to integrate 4x

117
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,590
over the region R.
And R in this case

118
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,520
was a circle centered at
(a, 0) and of radius a.

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
And then I said, well, I
don't want to do a lot of work

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,460
for this.

121
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,112
So I'm going to
not cheat, but I'm

122
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:23,070
going to use my knowledge
of the center of mass

123
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,940
to make this easier.

124
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,490
So the center of
mass is equal to 1

125
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,940
divided by the area of the
region times the integral of x

126
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,140
over the region.

127
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,670
So I want to find the
integral of x over the region,

128
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,550
I just solve for the integral
of x over the region.

129
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,450
I just solve for that part.

130
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,672
The center of mass-- from
just looking at the picture

131
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,380
and understanding what
the center of mass

132
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,480
means-- the center of mass
in the x component is a.

133
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,100
The area is pi a squared.

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
So I end up with
a pi a cubed when

135
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,860
I solve for the integral of x.

136
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,900
And then because I wanted
the integral of 4x,

137
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,930
I just multiply by 4.

138
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,000
And so the final answer
is actually 4 pi a cubed.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
So what I was trying
to find, if you

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,460
remember, was I was
trying to find the value,

141
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,710
when I integrated
over this curve,

142
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,980
of a certain vector field.

143
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,649
And that one was going to be a
little messy to do it that way.

144
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,190
But Green's theorem,
actually there's

145
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,250
a lot of cancellation
which makes it much easier,

146
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,630
and then the center of
mass is a nice little trick

147
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,580
to use at the end.

148
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,070
And then the calculation
is quite simple.

149
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,151
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
