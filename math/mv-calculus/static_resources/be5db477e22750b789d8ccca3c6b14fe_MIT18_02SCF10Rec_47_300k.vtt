CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.650
In this video, I'd like us to
see how geometric methods can

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.220
help us understand the flux of a
vector field across a curve.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.980
So in particular, what we're
going to do is try and use

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.400
geometric methods to compute
the flux of four different

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.140
vector fields F across curve
C. So I've labeled them for

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.870
later purposes.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.010
I've labeled them F1,
F2, F3, and F4,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.960
and they are as follows.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.080
F sub 1 is the vector field that
is a scalar function of

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.940
only the radius times the
vector x comma y.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.260
And the curve I'm interested
in in this

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.440
part is the unit circle.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.390
The second one, part b, is the
vector field that is g of r.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.990
Again, where g is a scalar
function and r is the radius--

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.010
so it depends only
on the radius--

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.410
times the vector minus y, x.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.470
And again the C will
be the unit circle.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.550
The third and fourth ones, we
use a different C, but they

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.720
will be the same there.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.590
I'll point that out.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.660
So in the third one, the vector
field is 3 times the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.970
vector (1, 1).

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.350
And C in this case will be
the segment connecting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.470
(0, 0) to (1, 1).

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.740
So it's a piece of the
line y equals x.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.500
And then in part d, F will be
3 times the vector (-1, 1).

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.510
And C is, again, this segment
from (0, 0) to (1, 1).

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.490
So again, what I'd like you to
do is rather than trying to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.740
parametrize the curve and do
the entire calculation, I'd

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.480
like to see you try and
understand the relationship

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.950
between each of these factor
fields F and the normal to the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.540
curve that they're on.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.310
And see if you can figure out
the flux based on that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.590
relationship.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.930
So why don't you pause the
video, give that a shot, and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.610
then when you're ready to see
how I did it, you can bring

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.860
the video back up.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.160
OK, welcome back.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240
Again, I'm going to try and use
my geometric intuition to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.140
understand what the flux is for
each of these four vector

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.020
fields along these
four curves.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.530
So what I'd like to do is
if I'm going to try and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.840
understand geometrically what's
happening, it's always

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.130
good to draw a picture.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.630
So I'm going to draw a picture
that I'll use for a and b, and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.350
then I'll draw another picture
later that I'll

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.690
use for c and d.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.970
So notice again in a, my curve
is the unit circle.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.670
And I have a somewhat explicit
understanding of what the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.440
vector fields are.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.880
So I'm going to draw the unit
circle and see if I can figure

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.750
out where F1 and F2 are.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.280
It's not a perfect unit circle,
but it looks sort of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.340
like the unit circle.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.540
So this is going to
be my unit circle.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.600
And what I want to point out
first is that I was not trying

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.700
to trick you, but just to help
you notice, that in a and b,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.130
they both depended on this
radial function.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.270
But the radius on the unit
circle is fixed at 1.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.390
So in both of these vector
fields, it will

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.500
simply be g of 1.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.340
So that will be a
constant value.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.760
So all that's giving me is
some scalar multiple of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.080
whatever the length
of this one is.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.470
So it's this direction times
this scalar g of 1.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.250
One other thing I want to point
out is that both of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.040
these vectors, F1 and F2, if I
ignore the g part, and I look

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.570
at just the x comma y and the
minus y comma x, is these

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.080
parts have unit length.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.500
And you should be able to see
that right away, because x and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.780
y are on the unit circle.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.650
And so the length of the vector
whose tail is at the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.190
origin and head is on
the edge of the unit

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.550
circle has length 1.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.790
And then you can easily see
that this vector and this

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.320
vector have the same length,
because their individual

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.920
components are the same
absolute value.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.520
We already understand a
few things about F1

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.910
and F2 right away.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.770
That all the length is coming
from this g, and g is fixed

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.430
all the way around the unit
circle at g of 1.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.330
Now let's figure out what the
flux is for these two things.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.520
So if you notice first, F sub
1 is the vector (x, y) times

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.190
the scalar g of 1.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.770
So if I come over here,
I want to point out--

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.250
I'll do this part in
white first-- that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.360
if I'm at this point--

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.080
this is the point (x, y)--

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.210
the vector (x, y) is equal
to this vector.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.190
So if I think about putting
that at this point--

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.520
I'm going to draw it here--

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.120
I get something that
looks like this.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.820
So this is F sub 1, probably.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.180
I'm going to have to make
one comment about that.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.700
But notice, this should
look like

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.460
it's all in one direction.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.600
So this is the vector (x, y).

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.900
If I slide it so its tail is
here, it's again in the same

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.800
direction, and now I've just
scaled it by g of 1.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.200
Now, this is assuming,
obviously,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.560
that g of 1 is positive.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.720
So we're going to assume that
throughout this problem.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.740
I'll mention what happens when
g is negative at the end.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.060
So this is my vector F sub 1.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.500
Let's think about what is the
normal to this curve.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.600
The normal to this curve,
actually at each point on the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.840
circle, points in exactly the
same direction as F sub 1.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.480
Because if I'm parametrizing
in this direction--

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.620
I'll draw one down here so we
can see what it looks like--

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.490
the normal-- actually, let
me come from there--

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.500
the normal is going to look
something like this.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.830
OK.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.130
So it would be connecting from
the origin to that point on

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.790
the circle, and keep going
out in that direction.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.600
That's the normal direction.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.150
So F sub 1, if g is a positive
function, it points in exactly

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.410
the same direction
as the normal.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.440
If g is a negative function,
it points in exactly the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.460
opposite direction.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.860
So F1 would be flipped
exactly around if g

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.350
was a negative function.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.710
So if I want to compute
the flux for part a--

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.800
I'll do it down here--

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.595
if I want to compute the flux,
remember, I'm taking the

00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:58.020
integral along the curve
of F dotted with n ds.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.400
Well, F dotted with
n is constant.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.620
And that's the main
point that's going

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.110
to make this easier.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.550
At each point--

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.090
I guess I should say F1--

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.160
F1 dotted with n is always
equal to the length of F1

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.230
times the length of n
times cosine of the

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.090
angle between them.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.560
With a very quick calculation,
you can see that winds up

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.990
being g of 1.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.720
So the only reason I don't have
to worry about absolute

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.930
value, is if g is positive, I'm

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.950
pointing in the same direction.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.950
If g is negative, I'm pointing
in the opposite direction.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.550
And so the cosine theta is minus
1 instead of plus 1.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.960
You might want to check that
for yourself, but this

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.320
is just g of one.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.380
So that's a constant.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.150
So this is actually equal
to g of 1 times the

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.820
integral over C of ds.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.960
Now, what is this?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.250
If I integrate this, I should
pick up exactly the

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.120
length of the curve.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.300
OK.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.200
Because this is the derivative
of arc length, so when I

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.090
integrate this, I
get arc length.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.490
But it's a unit circle, so the
arc length is just the

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.960
circumference of the
unit circle.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.500
So that's 2 pi times g of 1.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.312
OK.

00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:06.150
And that's all you get.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.560
That's it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.310
So we didn't actually have
to parametrize anything.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.250
We just had to understand F1
relating to the normal.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.360
So I didn't draw the normal
here, but if I take this

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.380
normal and I spin around to
here, the normal is in the

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.880
same direction as F sub 1.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.260
So now let's look at F sub 2.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.200
And let's do this first by
pointing something out about

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.750
the relationship between
F sub 2 and F sub 1.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.975
Notice that if I take F sub
1 and I dot it with F

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:32.630
sub 2, I get 0.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.900
Right?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.070
Because ignoring even the scalar
part, I get x times

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.590
minus y, plus y times
x, which gives me 0.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.640
If the scalars come along for
the ride, I still get 0.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.810
So F sub 1 and F sub
2 are orthogonal.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.970
And in fact--

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.460
you can do this for yourself--
but if I come over and draw

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.280
the picture, F sub 2 is
going to be F sub 1

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.560
rotated by 90 degrees.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.620
Something like this.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.590
This is my F sub 2.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.810
Again, if g of 1 was negative,
F sub 1 would be this

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.960
direction, and F sub 2 would
then be around here.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.940
But ultimately, it's not going
to matter in this case whether

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.860
g is positive or negative,
because notice what happens.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.470
If I want to integrate F sub 2
dotted with the normal, notice

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.460
the normal is in the same
direction as F sub 1, so F sub

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.400
2 dotted with the normal is 0.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.810
So if I'm going to integrate the
function 0 all along the

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.000
curve, I shouldn't be surprised
that my answer to

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.410
part b is 0.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.190
So there was even less
work in part b.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.260
Because I immediately had that
F sub 2 is really in the

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.740
direction of the tangent
to the curve.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.490
And so I have something in the
direction of the tangent

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.150
dotted with something in the
direction of the normal-- in

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.410
fact, the normal--

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.190
so I get 0.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.430
All right.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.750
So now I'm going to draw a
picture for c and d, and then

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.000
we're going to use that one.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.070
And I have to make sure
I come on this side.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.630
Sorry about that.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.880
So here is (0, 0).

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.100
And here is (1, 1).

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.930
Actually, you know what?

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.020
I'm going to make it
a little longer.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.160
I might need more room.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.970
So (1, 1) I'll make a
little further up.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.960
OK?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.192
(0, 0) and (1, 1) and
that's my curve.

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.260
There's (1, 1).

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.240
OK.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.710
Now, if I parametrize it in
this direction, then I can

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.360
draw my normal.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.100
Because it's a line segment, my
normal is constant in its

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.030
length and direction.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:39.040
So at any given point, it's
exactly equal to this vector,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.350
up to the right scaling.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:46.170
And it should be something
like (1, -1) divided

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.750
by square root 2.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.430
That's my normal.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.930
If you want it precisely,
that's what it is.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.520
You don't actually need it to
solve this problem, though.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.030
But that's what it is if
you want it precisely.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.260
Now let's look at what F3 is,
and then we'll look at what F4

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.780
actually is.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.450
So let's look at F sub 3.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.960
F sub 3 was the vector
3 times (1, 1).

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.560
So if we come back to our
picture, at any point on this

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.350
curve, if I go in the (1, 1)
direction, I stay parallel to

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.600
this curve.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.420
I don't want to draw the whole
thing, because it would take

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.340
up the entire curve.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.420
It's longer than the
curve itself.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.340
But F sub 3, at any
given point,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.520
points in this direction.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.920
So this is F sub 3, but not
as long as it actually is.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.500
But only the direction is going
to matter in this case.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.000
So F sub 3 is pointing
in this direction.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.500
So if I want to compute
the flux, I

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.870
dot it with the normal.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.850
But look at what happens.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.580
The normal is orthogonal to
F sub 3 at every point.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.760
And so F sub 3 dotted with
the normal is 0.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.850
And so again, for exactly the
same reason as part b, in part

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.960
c, the flux is 0.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.290
So again, it's exactly the same
that the vector field I

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.930
was looking at and I wanted to
compute the flux for, is

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.460
actually tangent to the
curve at every point.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.050
And so when I dot it to the
normal to the curve at every

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.870
point, I get 0.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.420
And so computing
the flux is 0.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.460
So now, I have one more to do,
and that one is part d.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.630
And in this case, F sub 4--

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.750
let me just remind you--

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.600
is 3 times the vector (-1, 1).

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.770
And so if we go back to our
picture here, F sub 4, if I

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.320
compare it to the normal, in
fact, what I get is very long.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.850
This is probably not
quite long enough.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:43.400
But that's at least the
direction of F sub 4.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.120
And so F sub 4 is exactly
the opposite

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.350
direction to the normal.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.580
So if I want to compute the
flux of F sub 4 along this

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.440
curve, all I have to understand
is F sub 4 dotted

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.120
with the normal and the
length of the curve.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.600
This is exactly the same type
of solution as part a.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.540
So let's notice this.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.690
First, F sub 4, the length
is 3 root 2.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.610
You can compute that
pretty quickly.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.870
The length of n is just 1.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.510
It's a normal.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.830
That's why this stuff
didn't really matter

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.950
what exactly it was.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.710
It's good to know what direction
it points in.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:23.090
So F sub 4 dotted with n is
exactly 3 root 2 times cosine

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.340
of the angle between
n and F sub 4.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.350
The angle is pi.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.610
You notice they differ by
180 degrees, right?

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.080
So it's cosine pi,
which is minus 1.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.160
So what I do in part d, is I'm
integrating along the curve

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.240
the constant negative
3 square root 2 ds.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.690
This is exactly F sub 4 dotted
with the normal.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.030
And so as before, this is going
to equal to negative 3

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.870
root 2 times the arc length.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.130
Because the integral over the
curve ds is going to be the

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.590
arc length.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.480
And the arc length is
very easy to see.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.590
You've gone over 1 and up 1.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.970
Right?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.050
So Pythagorean theorem,
understanding right triangles,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.290
however you want to do it,
the length of this

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.160
curve is root 2.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.380
So this works out to be negative
3 root 2 root 2,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.210
which is just negative 6.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.450
So let me just remind you, there
were four problems here.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.720
There are two sets of problems,
where in each case,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.560
you have one similar
to the other.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.490
So let me point this out
one more time, and just

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.530
sort of step back.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.060
We had a circle, and then
in the next part

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.140
we had a line segment.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.410
But in the circle, one of the
problems had the vector in the

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.930
direction of the normal, and
you wanted to compute

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.760
the flux for that.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.740
And in the other, the vector was
tangent to the curve, and

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.205
so it was orthogonal
to the normal.

00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:48.620
And you wanted to compute
the flux for that.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.310
Obviously, when you're tangent
to the curve and then

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.800
orthogonal to the normal,
you get 0.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.370
And that was the case
for b and for c.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.220
When you're normal to the curve
and of constant length--

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.580
which was the case actually
for both a and d--

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.810
then all you have to do is find
F dotted with the normal,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.320
and then find the arc length,
and multiply them together.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.010
So that was the real strategy we
had to use for a and for d.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.900
So hopefully, this helps you
see how the geometric

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.065
quantities are interacting to
understand the flux of a

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.200
vector field across a curve.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.340
And that's where I'll stop.
