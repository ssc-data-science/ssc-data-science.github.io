CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.850
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.260
We're going to let F be the
vector field that's defined by

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.720
r to the n, times the
quantity xi plus yj.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.600
And r in this case is x squared
plus y squared to the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.480
1/2 as it usually is.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.530
The square root of x squared
plus y squared.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.010
And then I'd like us to
do the following.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.190
Use extended Green's theorem to
show that F is conservative

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.240
for all integers n.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.870
And then find a potential
function.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.150
So there are two parts.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.140
The first part is that you
want to show that F is

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.110
conservative.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.570
And then once you know it's
conservative, you can find a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.840
potential function.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.440
So why don't you take a little
while to work on that.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.000
And then when you're feeling
good about your answer, bring

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640
the video back up, and I'll
show you what I did.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.440
OK, welcome back.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.300
So again, what was the
point of this video?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.430
We want to do two things.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.580
We want to work on
two problems.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.550
The first is to show that this
vector field F I've given you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.750
is conservative.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.260
And then we want to find
a potential function.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.640
And we want to be able to show
it's conservative for all

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.360
integers n.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.520
And what I want to point out
is that for certain integer

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920
values of n, we're going to run
into some problems with

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.410
differentiability
at the origin.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.720
OK?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.660
So we're going to try and deal
with all of it at once, and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.050
simultaneously deal with all
of the integers by allowing

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.650
ourselves to show that F is
conservative even if we don't

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.130
include the origin
in our region.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.370
OK.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.420
So I want to point out a few
things first. And the first

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.160
thing I want to point out is if
we denote F as we usually

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.200
do in two dimensions as (M,N),
then the curl of F is going to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.720
be N sub x minus M sub y.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.200
OK.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.250
I actually calculated these
earlier, but I want to point

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.130
out that M sub y is actually
equal to n times r to the n

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.145
minus 2, times xy.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:06.780
Let me make sure I wrote
that correctly.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.550
Yes.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.560
But that is also exactly
equal to N sub x.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.150
And so what does that give us?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.580
Since N sub x minus M sub y is
the curl of F when we have

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.250
this vector (M,N), we know that
the curl of F is equal to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.530
0 by this work.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.180
OK, now if our vector field
was defined on a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.680
simply-connected region, then
that's enough to show that F

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.250
is conservative.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.520
OK?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.010
We just use Green's theorem
right away.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.250
Right?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.650
But the problem is that we
are not necessarily on a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.590
simply-connected region because
we could have problems

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.310
at the origin.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.570
And so I'm going to deal
with this in a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.990
slightly different way.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.860
To show that F is conservative,
what

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.500
do I want to show?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.490
I want to show that when I take
the line integral F dot

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.830
dr over any closed loop
that I get 0.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.590
That's ultimately what
I'm trying to show.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.700
So there are fundamentally two
types of curves that I'm

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.220
concerned with.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.550
Two closed curves in r2 that
I'm concerned with, and I'm

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.460
going to draw a picture of those
two types of curves.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.110
So in r2 I'm going to have
curves that miss the origin.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.110
Some curve like this,
which I'll call C1.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.880
And then I'm going to have
curves that go around the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.020
origin, and I'll call this C2.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.020
OK?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.490
Fundamentally, there's a
difference between this curve

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.210
and this curve, because this
curve contains the region

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.940
where F is defined and
differentiable, right?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.310
Every point on the interior of
this curve, F is defined and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.940
differentiable and therefore,
I can apply regular old

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.610
Green's theorem here.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.300
OK?

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.000
So I know by Green's theorem,
the integral over the closed

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.180
curve C1 of F dot dr is equal
to 0, and that's simply

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.270
because the curl of
F is equal to 0.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.470
Right?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.050
We can immediately use Green's
theorem because we know that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.800
the integral over this loop C1
is equal to the integral over

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.260
this region of the curl of F.
That's just Green's theorem.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.900
So I can apply Green's
theorem here.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.460
Now the problem here is I can't
apply Green's theorem

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.010
because this origin
is a trouble spot.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.940
Right?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.680
I'm not necessarily
differentiable there, so I

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.660
have to be a little
more careful.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.160
OK, and so what I do is I'm
going to explain why

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.130
immediately I can get the
integral over C2 is

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.170
actually also 0.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.690
And what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to draw,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.230
hopefully, a circle
that contains C2.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.775
So I'm going to draw a circle.

00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:45.600
It's a lot of curves,
but this is supposed

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.420
to look like a circle.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.000
Sorry about that.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.190
It's a little big on the low
side, but it's a circle.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.490
OK.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.350
This is a circle.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.010
And I'm going to call this C3.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.640
Now, I can tell you right away
that the integral over the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.770
curve C3 of F dot dr is equal to
0, and let me explain why.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.550
OK?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.680
F is a normal vector field
relative to a circle.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.900
Let's look at this again.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.790
It's radial, and that's
why we know this.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.300
F is a radial vector field.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.880
It's really the vector field
(x,y) times a scalar,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.550
depending on the radius.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.520
So if I look at this
picture right here,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.630
then F is going to--

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.580
let me draw it in color--

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.080
F is going to, at any
given point, be

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.850
in the radial direction.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.670
But that is exactly normal
to the tangent

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.210
direction of this curve.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.280
So this is the direction F
points, and this is the

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.940
direction the tangent vector
points to the curve.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.200
But remember, F dot dr is the
same as F dotted with the

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.880
tangent vector ds.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.170
OK?

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.680
And so that is why for this
circle, it's immediately

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.940
obvious that F dot
dr is equal to 0.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.700
Because at any given point on
this circle, I'm taking a

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.110
vector field, I'm dotting it
with a vector field that's

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.160
orthogonal to it, so
I get 0, and when I

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.400
integrate 0 I get 0.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.670
OK?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.440
So that's why this is 0.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.540
And now where the extended
version of Green's theorem

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.500
comes in, is the fact that, if
I look in this region, F is

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.770
defined and differentiable.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.960
Right?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.030
F is defined and differentiable
in this entire

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.150
region that I've just shaded.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.650
Which is the region between
my circle and my curve C2.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.420
And what that tells me is that
because this one is 0--

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.470
when I integrate along this
curve it's 0-- the integral

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.890
along this curve also
has to be 0, right?

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.900
That's what you actually have
seen already when you talked

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.970
about the extended version
of Green's theorem.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.730
You can compare the integral
along this curve to the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.060
integral along this curve
because in the region between

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.220
them, F is everywhere defined
and differentiable.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.320
So you can apply Green's
theorem there.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.310
It just now has two boundary
components, instead of in this

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.920
case where it just has one
boundary component.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.610
And so since the integral on
this curve is 0, and the curl

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.170
of F is 0, and F is defined and
differentiable everywhere

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.560
in this region, that tells you
that the integral on the curve

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.804
C2 is also 0.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.200
Let me say that one
more time, OK?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.470
I'm going to label it in
blue so you can see it.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.660
I'm going to call this region
that's shaded R. So Green's

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.700
theorem says that the double
integral in R of the curl of F

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.040
is equal to the integral
around this curve.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.040
And then I come in and I go
around this direction and I

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.200
come back out, and that gives me
the entire integral of the

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.750
curl of F on this region.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.230
Right?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.900
The curl of F is 0 everywhere
in this region, so that

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.280
integral is 0.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.670
And so the sum of the integral
on C3 minus the integral on C2

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.760
has to be 0.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.230
Since this one is 0,
that one is 0.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.270
So you've seen this before.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.140
I just want to remind
you about where

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.840
that's coming from.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.780
All right.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.540
So now we have to do one other
thing, and that's we have to

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.600
find a potential function.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.830
OK, so let's talk about how to
find a potential function.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.920
I'm going to do this by one of
the methods we saw in lecture.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.380
I'm in R2, and I'm going to
start at a certain point and

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:35.320
I'm going to integrate
up to (x1,y1) from

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.370
this certain point.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.900
And then I'm going to
figure out what the

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.650
function is that way.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.720
So what I'm going
to do again--

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.350
I'll write it this way--

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.260
I'm going to figure out f of
(x1,y1) by integrating along a

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.060
certain curve, F dot dr.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.580
Now I can't do exactly what I
did previously, because for

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.000
certain values of n, I run into
trouble with integrating

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.750
F from the origin.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.760
So what I'm going to do is
instead of integrating from

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.020
the origin, I'm going
to integrate from

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.210
the point (1, 1).

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:06.440
OK?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.840
So I'm going to start at the
point (1,1), and I'm going to

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.420
integrate in the y-direction,
and then I'm going to

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.320
integrate in the x-direction.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.520
So this will be my first
curve and this will

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.440
be my second curve.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.610
And I will land at (x1,y1).

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.400
So again, this is one of the
strategies we've seen

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.630
previously.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.930
This is the idea that I'm going
to integrate in the

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.650
y-direction, from y equals
1 to y equals y1.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.055
So this will be the point
(1,y1), so x is fixed there.

00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:41.130
And I'm going to integrate in
the x-direction, from x equals

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.070
1 to x equals x1, when
y is equal to y1.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.710
So let's break this down.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.660
And let me remind you, also, the
integral along this curve

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.050
C of F dot dr should
be P dx plus Q dy.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.760
Right?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.560
And so I'm going to look at what
P dx is and what Q dy is

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.500
on C1 and on C2.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.770
All right.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.020
So let's do that.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.620
OK, so I have to remind myself
what P and Q actually are in

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.830
order to do this.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.470
So let me write that down,
because this will be

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.960
helpful: (P, Q).

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.540
P is r to the n, x, and
Q is r to the n, y.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.490
All right?

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.760
So that's what we're
dealing with here.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.050
I'm going to come back to this
picture, and then I'm going to

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.120
come back and forth a little
bit at this point.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.000
So if I want to integrate P dx
plus Q dy on the curve C1,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.010
what I need to observe
first is that x is

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.220
fixed, so dx is 0.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.076
So I'm actually just going
to integrate Qdy.

00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:49.720
All right.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.580
So the first integral
along C1 is just a

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.090
parameterization in y.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:11:00.480
So it's the integral from 0 to
y1 of Q evaluated at x equal

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.860
1, and y going from 1 to y1.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.090
SPEAKER 1: 1 to y1.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.060
CHRISTINE BREINER: y
going from 1 to y1.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.630
OK?

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.020
Sorry.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.650
Yes. y going from 1 to y1.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.760
Sorry about that.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:11.970
Right?

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.340
I was avoiding the origin, so
I'd better not put a 0 down

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.670
there, because that's where I
was running into problems. OK.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.780
So Q is r to the n, y.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:27.680
So I have to remember what r
is. r is x squared plus y

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.960
squared to the 1/2.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.250
So in this case, Q is: x is 1,
and then I square it and I get

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.490
1, and then I have y squared,
and then to the n over 2--

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:44.370
so this is my r to the n part
along the curve C1--

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.740
and then I multiply by y,
and then I take dy.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.760
So there are a lot of pieces
here, so let me just make sure

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.070
we understand what's
happening.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.980
I am interested in this entire
thing, P dx plus Q dy along

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.110
the curve C1.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.140
dx is 0 along that
curve. x is 1.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.690
And y is going from 1 to y1.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.540
So if I come back over
here, I see I'm only

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.340
interested in the Qdy part.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.740
y is going from 1 to y1.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.230
And then this is r to the n,
when x is 1 and y is y.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.340
And this is the y part.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.000
So this is exactly Qdy
on the curve C1.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.150
Now let's look at what happens
on the curve C2.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.780
So if I come back over here
again, I want to have P dx

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.870
plus Q dy on the curve C2.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.160
Notice y is fixed at y1
there, so dy is 0.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.760
And so I'm only interested
in the P dx part.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.650
Everything is going to
be in terms of x.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.920
And let's see if we can do
the same kind of thing.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.370
I'm going to be integrating
from 1 to x1.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.590
Now r is going to be of the
form x plus y1 squared,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.360
to the n over 2.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.280
And then--

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.450
P has an x here and not
a y-- times x dx.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.820
So again, P is r to the n times
x, so this is r to the n

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.790
times x exactly on
the curve C2.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.060
Because on C2, y is fixed at y1,
so that's why I actually

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.750
substituted in a y1 here.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.270
It's the same reason I
substituted in a 1 here for x,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.130
because x was fixed at
1 on the curve C1.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.080
So now I have to integrate
these two things.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.360
I'm going to just write down
what you get in both cases,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.460
because it's really
single-variable calculus at

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.120
this point in both cases.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.070
The easiest way to do this,
probably, in my mind, is to do

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.320
a u-substitution.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.070
Oops, I made a mistake.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.320
This should be an x squared.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:36.990
I apologize.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.605
This should be an x squared,
because this is supposed to be

00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:39.720
a radius, right?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.990
It's x squared plus whatever y
is squared, to the n over 2.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.320
So if you didn't see the squared
here, and you got

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.390
nervous, you were correct.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.210
There should be a
squared here.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.700
So anyway, I'm going to go
back to what I was saying

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.130
previously.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:56.430
To integrate these things, the
easiest thing to do is to take

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.080
what is inside the parentheses
and set it equal to u, and

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.880
then do a u-substitution
from there.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.290
So again, I'm not going to
actually do that for you, but

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.700
I'm going to tell you
what you get.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.980
Now, there are two different
situations.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.920
And the situations follow when
n is any integer except

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.290
negative 2, and then when
n is negative 2.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.110
And the reason is because when n
is negative 2, this exponent

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.550
is a minus 1.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.560
So when you integrate, you end
up with a natural log.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.820
So let me just point out the
two things that you get in

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.210
each case, and then we'll
evaluate and see what the

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.710
solutions are in each case.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.760
So I'm just going to at this
point write down what I got,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.920
because this is your
single-variable calculus.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:41.260
OK, so what I got when n was not
equal to minus 2, you get

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.490
the following thing.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:51.600
You get 1 plus y squared,
evaluated at n plus 2, over 2,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.420
over n plus 2.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.480
And this is evaluated
from 1 to y1.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.110
And then this one you get a
similar thing there, but now

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.250
the y1 is fixed here.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:05.860
So you get an x squared plus y1
squared, to the n plus 2,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.840
over 2, over n plus 2, evaluated
from 1 to x1.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.180
So here, the y1 is fixed and
it's the x-values that are

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.730
changing, and here the y-values
are changing.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.440
So when n is not equal to 2, I
get exactly this quantity when

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.570
I integrate these two
terms. And so now,

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.280
let's see what happens.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.960
OK?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.170
Exactly what happens
is the following.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.760
Notice that when I put in y1
here, I get a 1 plus y1

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.590
squared, to the n plus 2
over 2, over n plus 2.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.770
Right?

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.496
I'm not going to write it down,
because I'm going to

00:15:35.496 --> 00:15:37.270
show you it gets killed
off immediately.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.000
Where does it get killed off?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.140
It gets killed off when I
evaluate this one at 1.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.460
OK?

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.090
So the upper bound here is the
same as the lower bound here.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.000
When I put in a 1 here, I get
1 plus y1 squared to the n

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.940
plus 2 over 2 over n plus 2.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.450
It's a lot of n's and 2's.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.950
But the point is that when I
evaluate this one at y1 and I

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.570
evaluate this one at 1, I get
exactly the same thing, but

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.120
the signs are opposite and
so they subtract off.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.420
In the final answer, I'm not
going to see this upper bound

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.270
and I'm not going to see this
lower bound, because they're

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.460
going to subtract off.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.040
And what I'm actually left with
is just two terms. And

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.120
those two terms I'm going
to write up here.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.730
Those two terms are going to be
x1 squared plus y1 squared

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.650
to the n plus 2, over
2, over n plus 2.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.130
Minus, 1 plus 1--
which is just--

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.450
2 to the n plus 2, over
2, over n plus 2.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.570
What it this really?

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.410
This is just r to the
n plus 2, over n

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.880
plus 2, plus a constant.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.425
Because this is just a
constant for any n.

00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:45.610
And notice n is not
equal to minus 2--

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.480
negative 2.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.610
That was the place we
were going to run

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.080
into trouble otherwise.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.550
And so when n is not equal to
negative 2-- when you do all

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.480
the integration--

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.890
you should arrive at this as
your potential function.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.000
OK?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.100
And again, what I did was I
evaluated to make it simpler

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.140
on ourselves so we didn't have
to write everything out.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.620
I noticed that if I evaluate
this at the two bounds, and

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.370
evaluate this at the two
bounds, and I add them

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.510
together, that the evaluation
here plus the evaluation here

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.640
are the same numerically but
opposite in sign, and so they

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.240
subtract off.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.570
And then I just have
to evaluate at this

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.300
one and this one.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:26.000
So that's n not equal
to negative 2.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.790
Now let's do the n equal
to negative 2 case.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.320
OK, so now I'm integrating this
exact same thing in the n

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.090
equal to negative 2 case.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.980
And I'll just write down
again what I get by the

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.080
substitution.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.270
And what I get is natural log of
one plus y squared, over 2,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.740
evaluated from 1 to y1.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:52.420
Plus, natural log of x squared
plus y1 squared, over 2,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.140
evaluated from 1 to x1.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.640
Let me make sure I
have that right.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.550
Yes.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.070
And the same kind of thing is
going to happen that happened

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.690
before, in terms of when I put
y1 in here, and I put 1 in

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.370
here, I get the same thing but
with an opposite sign.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.980
Here it's a positive.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.540
It's natural log 1 plus
y1 squared over 2.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.850
And here it's natural log 1 plus
y1 squared over 2, but

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.240
because it's the lower bound,
it's a negative sign.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.080
So whatever I get here and what
I get here subtract off.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.680
And then in the end, I wind up
getting just the following two

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:33.680
terms. I get x1 squared plus
y1 squared over 2, minus

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.500
natural log of 2 over 2.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.580
So this term comes from
evaluating this at x1.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.120
And this term comes from
evaluating this one at y

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.260
equaling 1.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.900
And if you notice,
what is this?

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.110
This is exactly natural log
of r plus a constant.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.830
So let me step to the other side
so we can see it clearly.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.710
So this is natural log of r
squared, but by log rules,

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.510
that's really 2 times natural
log of r, so it divides by 2

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.660
and I'm just left with
natural log of r, and

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.220
this is just a constant.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.900
And so my potential function
in that case is exactly

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.812
natural log of r plus
a constant.

00:19:12.812 --> 00:19:14.870
All right, this was a long
problem, so I'm just going to

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.100
remind us where we came from
and what we were doing.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.350
So let's go back to
the beginning.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.060
So what we did initially, was we
had this vector field F. It

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.010
was a radial vector field. r
to the n times xi plus yj.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.930
And we wanted to first show that
it was conservative for

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.880
any integer value of
n, and then to find

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.350
its potential function.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.570
And obviously we do it in that
order, because if it's not

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.880
conservative, we're not going to
find a potential function.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.100
In this case, what I observed
first was that the

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.860
curl of F was 0.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:53.110
And so in places where I had
a closed curve that didn't

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.930
contain the origin, I knew that
the integral all around

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.230
that closed curve was 0 just
by Green's theorem.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.350
But if I had a closed curve
that contained the origin,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.000
because F is not differentiable
for all the n

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.790
values there, I have to
be a little careful.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.550
It's actually even 0, right?

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.040
When x is 0 and y is
0, I'm going to

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.020
get something 0 there.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.120
So I need to figure out
a way to determine the

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.090
line integral on C2.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.310
Right?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.070
And that was my goal.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.220
For any C2 that contains the
origin, how do I figure out F

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.100
dot dr.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.650
And so I just compared it to
what I get when I take F dot

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.260
dr around a circle.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.050
Because I know that I can always
find a circle bigger,

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.380
and then I can say I've
got this region here--

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.800
in between-- on which F is
defined everywhere, so I can

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.950
apply Green's theorem to
that inside region.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.090
And I know that the curl of F on
the inside region is 0, and

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.550
so the integral on C2 and C3
is going to agree, right?

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.720
Because the integral on
C3 I showed was 0 just

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.240
geometrically.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.140
And then the integral on
C2 then has to be 0.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.595
All right?

00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:59.420
And so that was just when you
were using the extended

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.460
version of Green's theorem.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.740
And then to find a potential
function, we came over here.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.130
And we had to avoid the
origin because of the

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.910
differentiability problem
at the origin.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:10.600
So we started--

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.250
instead of where we usually
start, which is from (0, 0)--

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.630
we started from the
point (1, 1).

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.470
And we just determined the
potential function going from

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.360
the point (1, 1) to the point
(x1, y1) along a curve that

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.040
went straight up so x was fixed,
and then along the

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.640
curve that went straight
over so y was fixed.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.040
And so then we were able to
break up this thing where I'm

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.940
integrating over C--

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.800
P dx plus Q dy--

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.170
into two separate pieces, and
each of them was fairly simple

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.300
to write down.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.930
So let's look at
what they were.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.180
This first one was where
we were moving up.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.440
And there was no dx. x
was just fixed at 1.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.180
And y was going from 1 to y1.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.980
Right?

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.260
And so x is fixed at 1,
so I put a 1 there.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.370
And y is going from 1 to y1.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.240
So I evaluate Q dy
on that curve.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.740
And then the next one was P dx
on the curve where I'm moving

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.620
straight across.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.970
Right? dy is 0 there, so I
just pick up the P dx.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.220
And my y value was fixed
at y1, and x was

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.320
varying from 1 to x1.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.260
And so then I just had to
be a little bit careful.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.670
I didn't show you exactly how
you integrate, but using a

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.950
substitution trick--

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.630
single-variable calculus--

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.970
shouldn't be too bad for
you at this point.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.770
We distinguished between when n
was not equal to negative 2

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.460
and when n was equal
to negative 2.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.110
In the case n not equal to
negative 2, we determined the

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.470
integral, we simplified, and
we got to a place where the

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.550
potential function was exactly
equal to r to the n plus 2

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.160
over n plus 2, plus
some constant.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.550
Then in the case where n was
equal to negative 2, when you

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.410
do the substitution, you get
a different integral.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.430
And in that case, you get
into natural log.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.630
And so again, we just
had the natural log.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.450
We have these different
functions.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.470
We're evaluating the
natural log of

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.820
these different functions.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.080
We have the bounds.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.940
We simplify everything, and we
get exactly to the place where

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.650
you have natural log of
r plus a constant.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.500
And so we found our potential
function in the case n is

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.190
equal to negative 2, and
then any other n value.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.160
So, a very long problem.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.700
I hope you got something
out of it.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.950
And this is where I will stop.
