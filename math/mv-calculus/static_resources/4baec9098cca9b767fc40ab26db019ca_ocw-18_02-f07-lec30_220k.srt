7
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
The other thing is the last
lecture before the break ended a

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
bit abruptly because I ran out
of time,

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
so just to summarize what the
main point was,

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
I mean probably you figured
this out if you looked at the

11
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
notes.
It is not that important,

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
but anyway.
I just wanted to remind you,

13
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
just to clarify what happened
at the end, we got the diffusion

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
equation from two bits of
information.

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
I mean the unknown,
in this partial differential

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
equation, is a function that we
call u that corresponds to the

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
concentration of some substance.
And we used a vector field that

18
00:01:04 --> 00:01:12
represents the flow of whatever
the substance is whose diffusion

19
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
we are studying.
And so we got two bits of

20
00:01:17 --> 00:01:25
information, one that came from
physics that said the flow goes

21
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
from high concentration to
smaller concentration.

22
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
And that told us that the flow
is proportional to a negative

23
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
gradient of a concentration.
And the second piece of

24
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
information that we got was from
the divergence theorem,

25
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
and that was the one I spent
time trying to explain.

26
00:01:50 --> 00:01:57
And that one told us that the
divergence of F is actually

27
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
negative partial u over partial
t.

28
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
When you combine these two
relations together that is how

29
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
you get the diffusion equation.
Sorry, I should say this is not

30
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
the statement of a divergence
theorem.

31
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
This is something that would
derive from it with quite a few

32
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
steps involved.
And so what we got out of that

33
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
is a diffusion equation because
we end up getting that partial u

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
over partial t is minus div F,
which is therefore positive k

35
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
times divergence of grad u,
which is what we denoted by del

36
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
square u,
the Laplacian.

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:59
So, that is how we got the
diffusion equation.

38
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
Anyway, I will let you have a
look at the notes that were

39
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
handed out in case you really
want to see more.

40
00:03:08 --> 00:03:16
I just wanted to give the
missing part of the last

41
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
lecture.
Let me just switch gears

42
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
completely and switch to today's
topic, which is line integrals

43
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
and work in 3D.
That is going to look a lot

44
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
like what we did in the plane,
except, of course,

45
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
there is a z coordinate.
You will see it doesn't change

46
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
things much when it comes to
computing a line integral.

47
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
It changes things quite a bit,
however, when it comes to

48
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
testing whether a field is a
gradient field.

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
That is why we have to be more
careful.

50
00:03:45 --> 00:03:57
Let's start right away with
line integrals in space.

51
00:03:57 --> 00:04:08
Let's say that we have a vector
field F with components P,

52
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
Q and R.
We should think of it maybe as

53
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
representing a force.
And let's say that we have a

54
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
curve C in space.
Then the work done by the field

55
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
will be the line integral along
C of F dot dr.

56
00:04:29 --> 00:04:34
That is a familiar formula.
And what we do with that

57
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
formula is also familiar,
except now, of course,

58
00:04:37 --> 00:04:44
we have a z coordinate.
We are going to think of vector

59
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
dr as a space vector with
components dx,

60
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
dy and dz.
When we do the dot product of F

61
00:04:56 --> 00:05:04
with dr that will tell us that
we have to integrate Pdx Qdy

62
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Rdz.
But it is still a line integral

63
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
so it is still going to turn
into a single integral when you

64
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
plug in the correct values.
So the method will be exactly

65
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
the same as in the plane,
namely we will find some way to

66
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
parameterize our curve,
x plus x, y z in terms of a

67
00:05:22 --> 00:05:30
single variable,
and then we will integrate with

68
00:05:30 --> 00:05:44
respect to that variable.
The way that we evaluate is by

69
00:05:44 --> 00:05:56
parameterizing C and express x,
y, z, dx, dy,

70
00:05:56 --> 00:06:07
dz in terms of the parameter.
Let's do an example just to

71
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
convince you that you actually
know how to do this,

72
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
or at least you should know how
to do this.

73
00:06:12 --> 00:06:21
Let's say that I give you the
vector field with components yz,

74
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
xz and xy.
And let's say that we have a

75
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
curve given by x equals t^3,
y equals t^2,

76
00:06:33 --> 00:06:40
z equals t for t going from
zero to one.

77
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
The way we will set up the line
integral for the work done will

78
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
be -- Well, sorry.
Before we actually set up the

79
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
line integral,
we need to know how we will

80
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
express everything in terms of t
and dt.

81
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
x, y and z, in terms of t,
are given here.

82
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
We just need to do also dx,
dy and dz.

83
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
By differentiating you get dx
is 3t^2 dt.

84
00:07:05 --> 00:07:14
That is the derivative of t^3,
dy will be 2t dt and dz will

85
00:07:14 --> 00:07:23
just be dt.
And we will evaluate the line

86
00:07:23 --> 00:07:36
integral for work.
That will be the integral of yz

87
00:07:36 --> 00:07:48
dx xz dy xy dz,
which will become -- yz is t^3

88
00:07:48 --> 00:08:04
times dx is 3t^2 dt plus xz is
t^4 times dy is 2t dt plus xy is

89
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
t^5 dt.
That just becomes the integral

90
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
from, well, I guess t goes from
zero to one, actually.

91
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
And we are integrating three
plus two plus one.

92
00:08:14 --> 00:08:22
That is 6t^5 dt which,
I am sure you know,

93
00:08:22 --> 00:08:30
integrates to t^6,
so we will just get one.

94
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
It is the same method as usual.
And if you are being given a

95
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
geometric description of a curve
then, of course,

96
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
you will have to decide for
yourself what the best parameter

97
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
will be.
It might be some time parameter

98
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
t like here.
It might be one of the

99
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
coordinates.
Here we could have used z as

100
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
our parameter because,
in fact, this curve is x equals

101
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
x3 and y equals z2.
And we could also have used

102
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
maybe some angle.
Well, not here,

103
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
but if we had been moving on a
circle or something like that.

104
00:09:04 --> 00:09:11
Any questions so far?
No.

105
00:09:11 --> 00:09:26
OK.
Well, 

106
00:09:26 --> 00:09:31
because we can do a bit more
practice,

107
00:09:31 --> 00:09:40
let's do another one where we
do the same vector field F but

108
00:09:40 --> 00:09:49
our curve C will be going from
the origin to the point (1,0,

109
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
0) along the x-axis.
Let's call that C1.

110
00:09:54 --> 00:10:02
Then to (1,1, 0).
Let's call that C2 by moving

111
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
parallel to the y-axis.
And then up to (1,1,

112
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
1) parallel to the z-axis,
let's call that C3.

113
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
I am sure that some of you at
least are suspecting what I am

114
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
getting at here,
but let's not spoil it for

115
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
those who don't see it yet.
OK.

116
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
If we want to compute the line
integral along this guy then we

117
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
have to break it into a sum of
three terms.

118
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
Well, maybe I should call that
C', not C, because that is not

119
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
the same C anymore.
I want to do the sum of the

120
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
line integrals along C1,
C2 and C3.

121
00:10:55 --> 00:11:13
And, well, if I look at C1 and
C2 they take place inside the x,

122
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
y plane.
In fact, you know that z will

123
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
be zero and dz will also be zero
on both of these.

124
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
And if you just look at the
formula for line integral in the

125
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
role of yz dx plus xz dy plus xy
dz,

126
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
well, it looks like if you plug
z equals zero and dz equals zero

127
00:11:37 --> 00:11:47
you will just get zero.
These are actually very fast.

128
00:11:47 --> 00:12:00
Let me write it.
This is going to be zero,

129
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
this is going to be zero,
this is going to zero,

130
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
and we will get zero.
Now, if we do C3,

131
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
well, there we might have to do
some calculation,

132
00:12:11 --> 00:12:18
but it won't be all that bad.
C3, well, x and y are both

133
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
equal to one.
And, of course,

134
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
because they are constant that
means dx is zero and dy is zero.

135
00:12:26 --> 00:12:35
On the other hand,
z varies from zero to one.

136
00:12:35 --> 00:12:42
If I look at the line integral
on C3 -- The first two terms,

137
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
yz, dx and xz dy go away
because the dx and dy are zero,

138
00:12:48 --> 00:12:55
so I am just left with xy dz.
But because x and y are one it

139
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
is just the integral of dz from
zero to one, and that will just

140
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
end up being one.
If add these numbers together,

141
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
zero plus zero plus one,
I get one again.

142
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
And, of course,
it is not a coincidence because

143
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
this vector field is a gradient
field.

144
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
I am sure some of you have
already figured out what it is

145
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
the gradient of.
Otherwise, we will figure it

146
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
out together.
And so that is why we get the

147
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
same answer for these two paths
going both from the origin to

148
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
(1,1, 1).
Maybe I should point out,

149
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
to make it clear,
that if you plug t equals zero

150
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
in up there you will get (0,0,
0).

151
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
If you plug t equals one,
you will get (1,1,

152
00:13:45 --> 00:13:56
1).
In fact -- F that we have here

153
00:13:56 --> 00:14:11
happens to be conservative.
And, if you plug the two curves

154
00:14:11 --> 00:14:20
together -- Well,
I am not really sure if I know

155
00:14:20 --> 00:14:28
how to plot this correctly.
It is not exactly how it looks.

156
00:14:28 --> 00:14:33
Whatever.
The first curve C goes from the

157
00:14:33 --> 00:14:39
origin to this point,
and so does C ',

158
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
just in a slightly more
roundabout way.

159
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
They both go from the origin to
(1,1, 1).

160
00:14:51 --> 00:15:00
It is not a surprise that you
will get the same answer for

161
00:15:00 --> 00:15:05
both line integrals.
And how do we see that?

162
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
Well, actually here it is not
very hard to find a function

163
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
whose gradient is this vector
field.

164
00:15:15 --> 00:15:21
Namely, the gradient of x,
y, z looks like it should be

165
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
exactly what we want.
If you take partial of this

166
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
with respect to x,
you will get yz,

167
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
then with respect to y,
xz, and with respect to z,

168
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
xy.
And so, in fact,

169
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
what was the easier way to
compute these line integrals was

170
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
to use the fundamental theorem
of calculus.

171
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
Once we have this remark,
we don't need to compute these

172
00:15:45 --> 00:15:56
line integrals anymore.
We can just use the fundamental

173
00:15:56 --> 00:16:08
theorem.
If we know this fundamental

174
00:16:08 --> 00:16:20
theorem -- -- for line
integrals,

175
00:16:20 --> 00:16:27
that tells us that the line
integral of a gradient field is

176
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
equal to the value of the
potential at the final point

177
00:16:33 --> 00:16:40
minus the value of the potential
at the starting point.

178
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
And that, of course,
only applies if you have a

179
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
potential.
So, in particular,

180
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
only if you have a conservative
field, a gradient field.

181
00:16:52 --> 00:16:58
Here, in our example,
we have to look at,

182
00:16:58 --> 00:17:06
let's call little f of x,
y, z that potential xyz,

183
00:17:06 --> 00:17:12
then we take f(1,1,
1) - f(0,0, 0).

184
00:17:12 --> 00:17:17
And that indeed is one minus
zero which is one.

185
00:17:17 --> 00:17:24
Everything is consistent.
All this stuff so far works

186
00:17:24 --> 00:17:32
exactly as in the plane.
Any questions?

187
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
No.
OK.

188
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
Let's try to see where things
do get a little bit different.

189
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
And the first such place is
when we try to test whether a

190
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
vector field is a gradient
field.

191
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
Remember when we had a vector
field in the plane,

192
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
to know whether it was a
gradient of a function of two

193
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
variables we just had to check
one condition,

194
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
N sub x equals M sub y.
Now we actually have three

195
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
different conditions to check,
and that means,

196
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
of course, more work.

197
00:18:07 --> 00:18:23

198
00:18:23 --> 00:18:34
OK.
So what is our test for

199
00:18:34 --> 00:18:44
gradient fields?
We want to know whether a given

200
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
vector field with components P,
Q and R can be written as f sub

201
00:18:50 --> 00:18:55
x, f sub y and f sub z for a
same function F.

202
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
And for that to possibly
happen, well,

203
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
we need certainly some
relations between P,

204
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
Q and R.
And, as before,

205
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
this comes from the fact that
the mixed second derivatives are

206
00:19:11 --> 00:19:16
the same, no matter in which
order you take them.

207
00:19:16 --> 00:19:21
If that is the case then I can
compute f sub xy,

208
00:19:21 --> 00:19:28
which is the same as f sub yx
in two different ways.

209
00:19:28 --> 00:19:35
F sub xy should be P sub y.
F sub yx, well,

210
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
since f sub y is Q,
that should be Q sub x.

211
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
That is a part of a criterion
that we already had when we had

212
00:19:43 --> 00:19:46
only two variables.
But now, of course,

213
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
we need to do the same thing
when we look at x and z or y and

214
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
z.
That gives us two more

215
00:19:53 --> 00:19:58
conditions.
P sub z is f sub xz,

216
00:19:58 --> 00:20:10
which is the same as f sub zx,
so it should be the same as R

217
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
sub x.
Finally, Q sub z,

218
00:20:14 --> 00:20:22
which is f sub yz,
equals f sub zy equals R sub y.

219
00:20:22 --> 00:20:33
We have three conditions,
so our criterion -- Vector

220
00:20:33 --> 00:20:41
field F equals <P,
Q, R>.

221
00:20:41 --> 00:20:46
And here, to be completely
truthful, I have to say defined

222
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
in a simply connected region.
Otherwise, we might have the

223
00:20:50 --> 00:20:53
same kind of strange things
happening as before.

224
00:20:53 --> 00:21:03
Let's not worry too much about
it.

225
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
For accuracy we need our vector
field to be defined in a simply

226
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
connected region.
And example is just if it is

227
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
defined everywhere.
If you don't have any evil

228
00:21:14 --> 00:21:21
eliminators then you can just go
ahead and there is no problem.

229
00:21:21 --> 00:21:36
It is a gradient field.
We need three conditions.

230
00:21:36 --> 00:21:43
Let's do it in order.
P sub y equals Q sub x.

231
00:21:43 --> 00:21:52
And we have P sub z equals R
sub x and Q sub z equals R sub

232
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
y.
How do you remember these three

233
00:21:55 --> 00:21:56
conditions?
Well, it is pretty easy.

234
00:21:56 --> 00:22:01
You pick any two components, 
say the x and the z component, 

235
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
and you take the partial of the
x component with respect to z,

236
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
the partial of the z component
with respect to x and you must

237
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
make them equal.
And the same with every pair of

238
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
variables.
In fact, if you had a function

239
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
of many more variables the
criterion would still look

240
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
exactly like that.
For every pair of components

241
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
the mixed partials must be the
same.

242
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
But we are not going to go
beyond three variables so you

243
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
don't need to know that.
This you need to know so let me

244
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
box it.

245
00:22:33 --> 00:22:51

246
00:22:51 --> 00:23:02
That is pretty straightforward.
Let's do an example just to see

247
00:23:02 --> 00:23:11
how it goes.
By the way, we can also think

248
00:23:11 --> 00:23:19
of it in terms of differentials.
Before I do the example,

249
00:23:19 --> 00:23:22
let me just say in a different
language.

250
00:23:22 --> 00:23:29
If we have a differential given
to us of a form Pdx Qdy Rdz is

251
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
going to be an exact
differential,

252
00:23:33 --> 00:23:40
which means it is equal to df
for some function F exactly and

253
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
of the same conditions.
That is the same thing.

254
00:23:43 --> 00:23:51
Just in the language of
differentials.

255
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
The example that I promised.
Of course, I could do again the

256
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
same one over there and check
that it satisfies the condition,

257
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
but then it wouldn't be much
fun.

258
00:24:02 --> 00:24:10
So let's do a better one.
Actually, let's do it in a way

259
00:24:10 --> 00:24:18
that looks like an exam problem.
Let's say for which a and b is

260
00:24:18 --> 00:24:29
a xy dx plus -- Oh,
it is not going to fit here.

261
00:24:29 --> 00:24:39
But it will fit here.
a xy dx ( x^2 z^3) dy (byz^2 -

262
00:24:39 --> 00:24:51
4z^3) dz, an exact differential.
Or, if you don't like exact

263
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
differentials,
for which a and b is the

264
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
corresponding vector field with
i, j and k instead,

265
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
a gradient field.
Let's just apply the criterion.

266
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
And, of course,
you can guess that what will

267
00:25:06 --> 00:25:11
follow is figuring out how to
find the potential when there is

268
00:25:11 --> 00:25:12
one.

269
00:25:12 --> 00:25:33

270
00:25:33 --> 00:25:40
Let's do it one by one.
We want to compare P sub y with

271
00:25:40 --> 00:25:45
Q sub x,
we want to compare P sub z with

272
00:25:45 --> 00:25:53
R sub x and we want to compare Q
sub z with R sub y where we call

273
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
P, Q and R these guys.
Let's see.

274
00:25:57 --> 00:26:04
What is P sub y?
That seems to be ax.

275
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
What is Q sub x?
2x.

276
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
Q is this one.
Actually, let me write them

277
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
down.
Because otherwise I am going to

278
00:26:16 --> 00:26:21
get confused myself.
This guy here,

279
00:26:21 --> 00:26:32
that is P, this guy here,
that is Q and that guy here,

280
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
that is R.
This one tells us that a should

281
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
be equal to two of the first
product that you hold.

282
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
OK. Let's look at P sub z.
That is just zero.

283
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
R sub x?
Well, R doesn't have any x

284
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
either so that is zero.
This one is not a problem.

285
00:26:56 --> 00:27:02
Q sub z?
Well, that seems to be 3z2.

286
00:27:02 --> 00:27:14
R sub y seems to be bz2,
so b should be equal to three.

287
00:27:14 --> 00:27:19
We need to have a equals two
and, this is an and,

288
00:27:19 --> 00:27:23
not or, b equals three for this
to be exact.

289
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
For those values of a and b,
we can look for a potential

290
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
using the method that we are
going to see right now.

291
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
For any other values of a and b
we cannot.

292
00:27:33 --> 00:27:38
If we have to compute a line
integral, we have to do it by

293
00:27:38 --> 00:27:42
finding a parameter and setting
up everything.

294
00:27:42 --> 00:27:57
Any questions at this point?
Yes?

295
00:27:57 --> 00:28:00
I see.
Well, if I got the same answer,

296
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
oh, did say bz^2 or 3bz^2?
Well, 3bz^2, for example, 

297
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
I would need b to be zero
because the only time that 3bz2

298
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
equals bz2 as not just at one
point but everywhere,

299
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
I need them to be the same
function of x,

300
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
y, z.
Well, if a coefficient of z2 is

301
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
the same that would be give b
equals 3b, that would give me b

302
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
equals zero.
If you got bz2 on both sides

303
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
then it would mean for any value
of b it works,

304
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
and you wouldn't have to worry
about what the value of b is.

305
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
Any other questions?
No.

306
00:28:41 --> 00:28:50
OK.
Now, how do we find the

307
00:28:50 --> 00:28:58
potential?
Well, there are two methods as

308
00:28:58 --> 00:28:59
before.
One of them,

309
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
I don't remember if it was the
first one or the second one last

310
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
time, but it really doesn't
matter.

311
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
One of them was just to say
that the value of F at the

312
00:29:10 --> 00:29:15
point,
let me call that x1, y1, z1, 

313
00:29:15 --> 00:29:22
is equal to the line integral
of my field along a well-chosen

314
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
curve plus,
of course, a constant, 

315
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
which is going to be the
integration constant.

316
00:29:30 --> 00:29:39
And the kind of curve that I
will take to do this calculation

317
00:29:39 --> 00:29:48
will just be my favorite curve
going from the origin to the

318
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
point x1, y1,
z1.

319
00:29:51 --> 00:29:57
And so, typically the most
common choice would be to go

320
00:29:57 --> 00:30:04
just first along the x-axis,
then parallel to the y-axis and

321
00:30:04 --> 00:30:11
then parallel to the z-axis all
the way to my point x1,

322
00:30:11 --> 00:30:14
y1, z1.
I would just calculate three

323
00:30:14 --> 00:30:18
easy line integrals.
Add them together and that

324
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
would give me the value of my
function.

325
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
That method works exactly the
same way as it did in two

326
00:30:27 --> 00:30:30
variables.
Now, I seem to recall that you

327
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
guys mostly preferred the other
method.

328
00:30:32 --> 00:30:34
I am going to tell you about
the other method as well,

329
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
but I just want to point out
this one actually doesn't become

330
00:30:37 --> 00:30:40
more complicated.
The other one has actually more

331
00:30:40 --> 00:30:42
steps.
I mean, of course,

332
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
here there are also a bit more
steps because you have three

333
00:30:45 --> 00:30:47
parts to your path instead of
two.

334
00:30:47 --> 00:30:54
You have three line integrals
to compute instead of two,

335
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
but conceptually it remains
exactly the same idea.

336
00:30:59 --> 00:31:07
I should say it works the same
way as in 2D.

337
00:31:07 --> 00:31:17
Not much changes.
Let's look at the other method

338
00:31:17 --> 00:31:24
using anti-derivatives.
Remember we want to find a

339
00:31:24 --> 00:31:29
function little f whose partials
are exactly the things we have

340
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
been given.
We want to solve,

341
00:31:31 --> 00:31:36
well, let me plug in the values
of a and b that will work.

342
00:31:36 --> 00:31:47
We said a should be two,
so f sub x should be 2xy,

343
00:31:47 --> 00:31:59
f sub y should be x2 plus z3,
and f sub z should be 3yz^2

344
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
minus 4z^3.
We are going to look at them

345
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
one at a time and get partial
information on the function.

346
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
And then we will compare with
the others to get more

347
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
information until we are
completely done.

348
00:32:15 --> 00:32:25
The first thing we will do,
we know that f sub x is 2xy.

349
00:32:25 --> 00:32:27
That should tell us something
about f.

350
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
Well, let's just integrate that
with respect to x.

351
00:32:31 --> 00:32:36
Let me write integral dx next
to that.

352
00:32:36 --> 00:32:41
That tells us that f should be,
well, if we integrate that with

353
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
respect to x,
2x integrates to x^2,

354
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
so we should get x2y.
Plus, of course,

355
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
an integration constant.
Now, what do we mean by

356
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
integration constant.
It means that for given values

357
00:32:53 --> 00:32:58
of y and z we will get a term
that does not depend on x.

358
00:32:58 --> 00:33:02
It still depends on y and z.
In fact, what we get is a

359
00:33:02 --> 00:33:07
function of y and z.
See, if you took the derivative

360
00:33:07 --> 00:33:12
of this with respect to x you
will get 2xy and this guy will

361
00:33:12 --> 00:33:16
go away because there is no x in
it.

362
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
That is the first step.
Now we need to get some

363
00:33:19 --> 00:33:21
information on g.
How do we do that?

364
00:33:21 --> 00:33:28
Well, we look at the other
partials.

365
00:33:28 --> 00:33:35
F sub y, we want that to be x^2
z^3.

366
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
But we have another way to find
it, which is starting from this

367
00:33:41 --> 00:33:50
and differentiating.
Let me try to use color for

368
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
this.
Now, if I take the partial of

369
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
this with respect to y,
I am going to get a different

370
00:33:58 --> 00:34:06
formula for f sub y.
That will be x^2 plus g sub y.

371
00:34:06 --> 00:34:15
Well, if I compare these two
expressions that tells me that g

372
00:34:15 --> 00:34:23
sub y should be z3.
Now, if I have this I can

373
00:34:23 --> 00:34:32
integrate with respect to y.
That will tell me that g is

374
00:34:32 --> 00:34:39
actually yz^3 plus an
integration constant.

375
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
That constant,
again, does not depend on y,

376
00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
but it can still depend on z
because we still have not said

377
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
anything about partial with
respect to z.

378
00:34:49 --> 00:34:54
In fact, that constant I will
write as a function h of z.

379
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
If I have this function of z
and I take its partial with

380
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
respect to y,
I will still get z^3 no matter

381
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
what h was.
Now, how do I find h?

382
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
Well, obviously,
I have to look at f sub z.

383
00:35:09 --> 00:35:41
 
 

384
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
F sub z.
We know from the given vector

385
00:35:47 --> 00:35:53
field that we want it to be
3yz^2 minus 4z^3.

386
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
In case you are wondering where
that came from,

387
00:35:56 --> 00:36:01
that was R.
But that is also obtained by

388
00:36:01 --> 00:36:09
differentiating with respect to
z what we had so far.

389
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
Sorry.
What did we have so far?

390
00:36:15 --> 00:36:20
Well, we had f equals x^2y plus
g.

391
00:36:20 --> 00:36:30
And we said g is actually yz^3
plus h of z.

392
00:36:30 --> 00:36:37
That is what we have so far.
If we take the derivative of

393
00:36:37 --> 00:36:44
that with respect to z,
we will get zero plus 3yz^2

394
00:36:44 --> 00:36:51
plus h prime of z,
or dh dz as you want.

395
00:36:51 --> 00:36:59
Now, if we compare these two,
we will get the derivative of

396
00:36:59 --> 00:37:03
h.
It will tell us that h prime is

397
00:37:03 --> 00:37:08
negative for z3.
That means that h is negative

398
00:37:08 --> 00:37:13
z^4 plus a constant.
And this it is at last an

399
00:37:13 --> 00:37:17
actual constant.
Because it does not depend on z

400
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
and there is nothing else for it
to depend on.

401
00:37:21 --> 00:37:33
Now we plug this into what we
had before, and that will give

402
00:37:33 --> 00:37:44
us our function f.
We get that f=x^2y yz^3 - z^4

403
00:37:44 --> 00:37:49
plus constant.
If you just wanted to find one

404
00:37:49 --> 00:37:51
potential, you can just forget
the constant.

405
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
This guy was a potential.
If you want all the potentials

406
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
they differ by this constant.
OK.

407
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
Just to recap the method what
did we do?

408
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
We started with -- And,
of course, you can do it in

409
00:38:04 --> 00:38:07
whichever order you prefer,
but you have to still follow

410
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
the systematic method.
You start with f sub x and you

411
00:38:11 --> 00:38:13
integrate that with respect to
x.

412
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
That gives you f up to a
function of y and z only.

413
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
Now you compare f sub y as
given to you by the vector field

414
00:38:25 --> 00:38:32
with the formula you get from
this expression for f.

415
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
And, of course,
this one will involve g sub y.

416
00:38:36 --> 00:38:41
Out of this,
you will get the value of g sub

417
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
y.
When you have g sub y that

418
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
gives you g up to a function of
z only.

419
00:38:48 --> 00:38:52
And so now you have f up to a
function of z only.

420
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
And what you will do is look at
the derivative with respect to

421
00:38:57 --> 00:38:59
z,
the one you want coming from

422
00:38:59 --> 00:39:02
the vector field and the one you
have coming from this formula

423
00:39:02 --> 00:39:05
for f,
match them and that will tell

424
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
you h prime.
You will get h and then you

425
00:39:09 --> 00:39:20
will get f.
Any questions?

426
00:39:20 --> 00:39:25
Who still prefers this method?
OK, still most of you.

427
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
Who is thinking that maybe the
other method was not so bad

428
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
after all?
OK. That is still a minority.

429
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
You can choose whichever one
you prefer.

430
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
I would encourage you to get
some practice by trying both on

431
00:39:42 --> 00:39:47
least a couple of examples just
to make sure that you know how

432
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
to do them both and then stick
to whichever one you prefer.

433
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
Any questions on that?
No. I guess I already asked.

434
00:39:59 --> 00:40:07
Still no questions?
OK.

435
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
The next logical thing is going
to be curl.

436
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
And the theorem that is going
to replace Green's theorem for

437
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
work in this setting is going to
be called Stokes' theorem.

438
00:40:21 --> 00:40:34
Let me start by telling you
about curl in 3D.

439
00:40:34 --> 00:40:39
Here is the statement.
The curl is just going to

440
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
measure how much your vector
field fails to be conservative.

441
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
And, if you want to think about
it in terms of motions,

442
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
that also will measure the
rotation part of the motion.

443
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
Well, let me first give a
definition.

444
00:40:55 --> 00:41:00
Let's say that my vector field
has components P,

445
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
Q and R.
Then we define the curl of F to

446
00:41:06 --> 00:41:16
be R sub y minus Q sub z times i
plus P sub z minus R sub x times

447
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
j plus Q sub x minus P sub y
times k.

448
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
And of course nobody can
remember this formula,

449
00:41:25 --> 00:41:28
so what is the structure of
this formula?

450
00:41:28 --> 00:41:35
Well, you see,
each of these guys is one of

451
00:41:35 --> 00:41:43
the things that have to be zero
for our field to be

452
00:41:43 --> 00:41:52
conservative.
If F is defined in a simply

453
00:41:52 --> 00:42:05
connected region then we have
that F is conservative and is

454
00:42:05 --> 00:42:15
equivalent to if and only if
curl F is zero.

455
00:42:15 --> 00:42:19
Now, an important difference
between curl here and curl in

456
00:42:19 --> 00:42:23
the plane is that now the curl
of a vector field is again a

457
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
vector field.
These expressions are functions

458
00:42:27 --> 00:42:31
of x, y, z and together you form
a vector out of them.

459
00:42:31 --> 00:42:36
The curl of a vector field in
space is actually a vector

460
00:42:36 --> 00:42:43
field, not a scalar function.
I have delayed the inevitable.

461
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
I have to really tell you how
to remember this evil formula.

462
00:42:47 --> 00:42:55
The secret is that,
in fact, you can think of this

463
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
as del cross f.
Maybe you have seen that in

464
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
physics.
This is really where this del

465
00:43:04 --> 00:43:08
notation becomes extremely
useful, because that is

466
00:43:08 --> 00:43:13
basically the only way to
remember the formula for curl.

467
00:43:13 --> 00:43:30
 
 

468
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34
Remember we introduced the dell
operator.

469
00:43:34 --> 00:43:42
That was this symbolic vector
operator in which the components

470
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47
are the partial derivative
operators.

471
00:43:47 --> 00:43:59
We have seen that if you apply
this to a scalar function then

472
00:43:59 --> 00:44:08
that will give you the gradient.
And we have seen that if you do

473
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
the dot product between dell and
a vector field,

474
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
maybe I should give it
components P,

475
00:44:19 --> 00:44:24
Q and R,
you will get partial P over

476
00:44:24 --> 00:44:30
partial x plus partial Q over
partial y plus partial R over

477
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
partial z,
which is the divergence.

478
00:44:36 --> 00:44:47
And so now what is new is that
if I try to do dell cross F,

479
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
well, what is dell cross F?
I have to set up a

480
00:44:53 --> 00:44:58
cross-product between this
strange thing that is not really

481
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
a vector.
I mean, I cannot really think

482
00:45:02 --> 00:45:05
of partial over partial x as a
number.

483
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
And my vector field <P,
Q, R>.

484
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
See, that is really a
completely perverted use of a

485
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
determinant notation.
Initially, determinants were

486
00:45:18 --> 00:45:21
just supposed to be you had a
three by three table of numbers

487
00:45:21 --> 00:45:23
and you computed a number out of
them.

488
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28
These guys are functions so
they count as numbers,

489
00:45:28 --> 00:45:33
but these are vectors and these
are partial derivatives.

490
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
It doesn't really make much
sense, except this notation.

491
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
If you try to enter this into a
calculator or computer,

492
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
it will just yell back at you
saying are you crazy.

493
00:45:48 --> 00:45:50
[LAUGHTER]
We just use that as a notation

494
00:45:50 --> 00:45:53
to remember what is in there.
Let's try and see how that

495
00:45:53 --> 00:45:55
works.
The component of i in this

496
00:45:55 --> 00:45:58
cross-product,
remember that is this smaller

497
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
determinant,
that smaller determinant is

498
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
partial over partial y of R
minus partial over partial z of

499
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
Q,
the coefficient of i.

500
00:46:10 --> 00:46:14
And that seems to be what I had
over there.

501
00:46:14 --> 00:46:18
If not then I made a mistake.
Minus the next determinant

502
00:46:18 --> 00:46:20
times z.
Remember there is always a

503
00:46:20 --> 00:46:23
minus sign in front of a j
component when you do a

504
00:46:23 --> 00:46:27
cross-product.
The other one is partial over

505
00:46:27 --> 00:46:33
partial x R minus partial over
partial z of P plus the

506
00:46:33 --> 00:46:39
component of z which is going to
be partial over partial x Q

507
00:46:39 --> 00:46:46
minus partial over partial y P.
And that is indeed going to be

508
00:46:46 --> 00:46:48
the curl of F.
In practice,

509
00:46:48 --> 00:46:51
if you have to compute the curl
of a vector field,

510
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
you know, don't try to remember
this formula.

511
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
Just set up this cross-product
with whatever formulas you have

512
00:46:59 --> 00:47:04
for the components of a field
and then compute it.

513
00:47:04 --> 00:47:15
Don't bother to try to remember
the general formula,

514
00:47:15 --> 00:47:25
just remember this.
What is the geometric

515
00:47:25 --> 00:47:35
interpretation of curl,
just to finish?

516
00:47:35 --> 00:47:48
In a way, I will say just curl
measures the rotation component

517
00:47:48 --> 00:47:55
in a velocity field.
An exercise that you can do,

518
00:47:55 --> 00:47:59
which is actually pretty easy
to check, is say that we have a

519
00:47:59 --> 00:48:04
fluid that is just rotating
about the x-axis uniformly.

520
00:48:04 --> 00:48:10
Your fluid is just rotating
like that about the z-axis.

521
00:48:10 --> 00:48:15
If I take a rotation about the
z-axis.

522
00:48:15 --> 00:48:28
That is given by a velocity
field with components at angular

523
00:48:28 --> 00:48:35
velocity omega.
That will be negative omega

524
00:48:35 --> 00:48:41
times y, then omega x and zero.
And the curl of that you can

525
00:48:41 --> 00:48:45
compute, and you will find two
omega times k.

526
00:48:45 --> 00:48:48
Concretely, 
this curl gives you the angular

527
00:48:48 --> 00:48:51
velocity of the rotation,
well, with a factor two but

528
00:48:51 --> 00:48:53
that doesn't matter,
and the axis of rotation, 

529
00:48:53 --> 00:48:56
the direction of the axis of
rotation.

530
00:48:56 --> 00:48:59
It tells you it is rotating
about a vertical axis.

531
00:48:59 --> 00:49:01
And, in general,
if you have a complicated

532
00:49:01 --> 00:49:03
motion some of it might be,
you know, there is a

533
00:49:03 --> 00:49:05
translation.
And then within that

534
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
translation there is maybe
expansion and rotation and

535
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
sharing and everything.
And the curl will compute how

536
00:49:11 --> 00:49:14
much rotation is taking place.
It will tell you,

537
00:49:14 --> 00:49:16
say that you have a very small
solid,

538
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
I don't know like a ping pong
ball in your flow,

539
00:49:19 --> 00:49:21
and it is just going with the
flow,

540
00:49:21 --> 00:49:25
it tells you how it is going to
start rotating.

541
00:49:25 --> 00:49:32
That is what curl measures.
On Thursday we will see Stokes'

542
00:49:32 --> 00:49:37
theorem, which will be the last
ingredient before the next exam.

543
00:49:37 --> 00:49:40
And then on Friday we will
review stuff.

544
00:49:40 --> 00:49:41
