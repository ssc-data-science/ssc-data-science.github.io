DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,310
The problem I'd like to work
with you today is the

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,060
intersection of two parametrized
lines.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,910
So we have two lines here.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,460
L1, given with the
parametrization in terms of

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,820
the variable t.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,435
And L2, also given with the
parametrization in terms of

9
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,570
the variable t.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,220
So the first question that I
want us to answer is do these

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,250
lines intersect?

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,020
And if so, then we
want to find out

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,370
where do they intersect.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,350
So why don't you pause the
video and work on this.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,590
And we can check back in
a moment and we'll see

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,840
how I solved it.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,230

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,980
OK, welcome back.

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,930
Let's get started.

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,920
So we have these two
lines in space.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Before we start doing any
computations, I find it useful

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,710
to draw a picture.

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,190
So let's see what's going on.

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:07,210

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,450
OK.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,730
So we have these two lines.

27
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,150
We can just find some common
points on the lines.

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,220
So, well, if we put in t equals
0 here, then it looks

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,780
like we get the point
2 comma 1.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,820

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,650
OK.

32
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:39,920
And now if we plug in, let's
say-- t is minus 1 here-- then

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,220
we get, if we plug in t equals
minus 1 we get x

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,960
is 3 and y is 0.

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,350

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,600
So there's our line L1.

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,320

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,380
And now let's see, L2.

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,260
If we plug in t equals
0, we get 2--

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,370
1, 2, 3--

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,260
4.

42
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:15,060
And if we plug in, let's say,
t equals minus 1 again, then

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,215
we get 1 and 2.

44
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:24,580

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,970
OK?

46
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,500
So there is L2.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,940
And indeed, it does look
like they intersect.

48
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,620
We could have probably guessed
that they intersect by looking

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,670
back over here at the formulas
for L1 and L2, because we see

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,210
that the sort of direction that
this is moving in, we can

51
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,150
take derivatives in t.

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,670
And we see that L2 is, this
line is moving in the

53
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,850
direction 1 comma 2.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,490
And L1 is moving in the
direction minus 1 comma 1.

55
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,600
And so those directions
are not parallel.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,200
And so we know that the only way
the two lines could fail

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,970
to intersect is if
they're parallel.

58
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,740
So actually, even without
drawing this, we could have

59
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,990
guessed that these lines
do intersect.

60
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,280

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,530
So now we know that these
lines intersect.

62
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,210
And in fact, it even looks,
you know, it kind of looks

63
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,120
like they intersect--

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,510
from our sketch--

65
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,240
at the point-- it looks like--

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,990
1 comma 2.

67
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,430
It seems to be the point
of intersection.

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,990
But, you know, we got
a little bit lucky

69
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,000
with our sketch here.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
So let's see if that's
actually true.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,890
Let's see if we can verify this
in the general way that

72
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,140
we discussed in lecture.

73
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,990

74
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,100
So, now there is one place where
we have to be careful.

75
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,320
We have two lines here, and we
parametrized both of these

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,285
with the variable t.

77
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:47,330
But we need to keep in mind
that t is what's called a

78
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,130
dummy variable.

79
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,920
It doesn't have any geometric
meaning to the problem.

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,760
And in particular, what I want
to caution you about is if we

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,780
just start solving these two
equations algebraically as

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,480
they're given to us with the
variable t, the problem that

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,405
we could run into is that, you
kow, we're sort of moving--

84
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,240

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,365
as we vary t-- we're moving
along this line, and as we

86
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,390
vary t again, we're moving
along this line.

87
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,720
And you see we're moving
at the same time.

88
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
And so that's really solving
a different problem.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,170
That's not asking about when did
these lines intersect, but

90
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,750
that would be asking about when
do two particles on these

91
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,600
lines collide, which is
a harder problem.

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,660
So instead, what we need to do
is we need to give a change of

93
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,000
variables for the line L2.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,060
So what I want to do is
I'm going to write L2.

95
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,740
I'm just going to write the same
equations, but I'm going

96
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,000
to introduce a new
variable, u.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,790
So x is 2 plus u, and
y is 4 plus 2u.

98
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,270

99
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,480
OK.

100
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,770
So now once we've done that,
to find the point of

101
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,970
intersection, well, the point
of intersection is going to

102
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,800
precisely be a point on L2 where
the x-coordinate and the

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,770
y-coordinate agree with another
point on L1 with the

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,364
same x- and y-coordinate.

105
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:20,590
So that is, we have the, what
we want to do is we want to

106
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,450
set the x-coordinate for L2.

107
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,310
We want to set this equal to the
x-coordinate for L1, which

108
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,895
is 2 minus t.

109
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,540
So this was for L1.

110
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,410
And similarly here, we want to
set the y-coordinate for L2

111
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,940
equal to the y-coordinate
for L1.

112
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,520
So now if you think about it, if
we can solve this system of

113
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,970
equations, then what we've done
is we've simultaneously

114
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,780
found a point which is
on L1 and on L2.

115
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,580
And that's our goal.

116
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,000
So that will be a point
of intersection.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,560
OK, so now we just have this
system of two linear equations

118
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,565
and two variables, and we
just need to solve it.

119
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:06,260

120
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,160
Now we could do, you know, in
general, with an equation like

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,530
this, we might try to add or
subtract the equations.

122
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,850
But this one is so simple,
that I see that the top

123
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:22,560
equation is just the
same thing as t

124
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,270
equaling to minus u.

125
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,270
That's what the top equation
says if we cancel the 2's.

126
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,310
And so if we plug that into the
next equation, then we get

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,310
4 plus 2u equals 1 minus u.

128
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:43,560
And so then we can solve this,
and we get, so it looks like 3

129
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:52,240
equals minus 3u, which tells us
that u equals minus 1, and

130
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,700
then that tells us that
t equals plus 1.

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,260

132
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,850
OK?

133
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,840
So we found our parameters
t and u.

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,290
And we're not quite done yet.

135
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,410
What we need to do is we
need to go back to our

136
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,450
parametrization.

137
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,000
So let me go back over to our
original parametrization here,

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,590
and we have L1 was 2 minus
t and 1 plus t.

139
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,210
And over here, we found that t
equals 1 was the value that

140
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,160
we're after.

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,970
So that tells us that x is 1--

142
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,390
2 minus 1--

143
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,420
and y is 2.

144
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,700
Excuse me.

145
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,950
I wrote that in a funny way.

146
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,889

147
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,850
x is 1 and y is 2.

148
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,135
Now, just as a reality check.

149
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,200

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,660
We also found that if we solved
for L2, we wanted the

151
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,170
variable u to be equal
to minus 1.

152
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,090

153
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,040
So we had 2 plus u,
and 4 plus 2u.

154
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
And so let's see what happens
when we plug in u

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,140
equals minus 1 here.

156
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:19,180
We again get x equals
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

157
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,370
And y equals 4 plus
minus 2 is 2.

158
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,270
So we just double check that
this is a point of

159
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,660
intersection of both lines.

160
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,900
And I'll leave it at that.

161
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,045
