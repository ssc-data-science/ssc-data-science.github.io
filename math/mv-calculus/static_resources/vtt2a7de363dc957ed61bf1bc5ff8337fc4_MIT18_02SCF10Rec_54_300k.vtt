CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:12.210
In this video I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.890
We're going to let capital D
denote the portion of the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.850
solid sphere of radius 1 that's
centered at 0, 0, 1,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.110
which also lies about
the plane z equal 1.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.385
And then I'd like us to first
supply the limits for D in

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:27.610
spherical coordinates.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.960
In other words, I want you to
determine the values for rho,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.380
theta, and phi that will give us
all of D. And then, I would

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.790
like us to just set up the
integral for the average

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.540
distance of a point in
D from the origin.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.360
So there are two parts
to this problem.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.100
The first is to determine what
values of rho, theta, and phi

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.810
describe this solid region D.
And then second is just set up

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.350
the integral for the average
distance of a point in that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590
region from the origin.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.940
So why don't you pause the
video, work on those, and then

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880
when you're ready to see my
solutions, you can bring the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.130
video back up.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.230
OK, welcome back.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.870
Well, I would say from looking
at this problem, actually part

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.330
a is potentially a little bit
more hazardous for some of us

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.380
then part b.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.560
Once we know the bounds that
describe D, it's not too hard

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.950
to set up this integral.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.940
So the hard part of this problem
is understanding how

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.460
to write this solid region D
in spherical coordinates.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.705
But it's actually really not
that hard either, so I'm going

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:40.430
to try and take us through
it in a reasonable way.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.700
So the first thing: I'm going
to draw a very rough picture

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.940
of the region so we understand
what it looks like.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.490
So in order to do part a.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.970
And if you did not do this, I
would highly recommend that

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
next time you encounter such a
problem, you begin by drawing

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.100
yourself a picture.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.370
Even if it's not a great
picture, it will give you some

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.010
intuition about what's
happening.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.728
So let me first draw the axes.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:05.410
And ultimately what I have--

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.010
say here, is the point
(0, 0, 1)--

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:16.390
I have a sphere that's looking
in the z-y plane.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.970
It looks something like this.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.120
And so it has this depth here.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660
And that's the solid sphere
I want to be considering.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.870
And then I'm going to be
removing the bottom half.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.170
I'm only going to be looking at
the part that is above the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.540
z equals 1 plane.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.120
So actually it's going to be
all of the circular slices

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.270
that are in the top
half in the upper

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.500
hemisphere of this sphere.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.810
And so it's this solid
region there.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.240
That's D.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.280
And what I want to do
is to determine rho

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.480
and theta and phi.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.800
Actually, the theta is
the easy one, right?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.900
Because theta at each value
here, I go all the way around

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.150
in the theta direction.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.240
At any given height or radius,
I want to go all the way

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.120
around in the theta direction
from 0 to 2 pi.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.670
So my theta bounds are
the easy ones.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.200
I'm covering 0 to
2 pi in theta.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.090
Because if I cut off the back
half of the sphere, I want to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.240
only have a restricted
value of theta.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.600
But because I'm covering all
the way around and my

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.740
restriction is only in the
bottom half, my theta values

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.540
haven't changed.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.870
So theta is easy: 0 and 2 pi.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.030
Now the harder ones are going
to be rho and phi.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.730
But in fact, actually, phi
is not that hard either.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.320
I notice phi is the angle that
I make from the z-axis to any

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.960
given point.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.170
So I notice that I certainly am
including the point where

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.680
phi is 0, and then I'm going
all the way down to a point

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.380
out here, which is a 45 degree
angle with the z-axis.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.930
So phi is also easy.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.850
It's actually just between
0 and pi over 4.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.180
And the rho will be the
slightly harder part.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.460
So that's really the only really
tricky part in this

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.070
problem is determining
the rho value.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.970
Now, the rho value, to get the
outer boundary, we'll look at

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.430
that part first.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.750
Well, the boundary of this
sphere here has a certain

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.540
equation in x, y, and z
that we know, right?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.710
It's x squared plus y squared
plus the quantity z minus 1

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.360
squared equals 1.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.780
I mean, that's just the equation
for a sphere of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.170
radius 1 centered
at (0, 0, 1).

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.060
So I'm going to write that here,
and we're going to show

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.360
how we can manipulate that.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.310
Right?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.730
x squared plus y squared
is r squared.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.290
r squared is rho squared
sine squared phi.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.180
So I can replace this by rho
squared sine squared phi.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.220
If you didn't know that
immediately, you could make

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.140
the substitution for x and y in
spherical coordinates, and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.990
it simplifies to this.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.660
So either way, if you didn't
know r squared was this, you

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.050
can get it from just doing
the substitution.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.020
And then z is going to
be rho cosine phi.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.430
So here, I'm going to have
a rho cosine phi minus 1

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.650
quantity squared equals 1.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.400
This in the spherical
coordinates is describing the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.490
boundary of this entire
sphere, right?

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.780
And so I can actually
simplify this.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.980
It's not too hard.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.690
If I square this, I get
a little cancellation.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.380
And then because I want
my rho to be--

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.070
I'm assuming in this region,
rho is greater than 0--

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.450
I can do a little
simplification.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.112
I come up with the fact that rho
is equal to 2 cosine phi.

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.070
And let's describe exactly
where that is.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.890
That's the entire boundary
of this entire sphere is

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.470
described by rho is equal
to 2 cosine phi.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.810
And so I want to think about
what my bounds are for rho.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.620
Actually, I'm going to grab
a piece of colored chalk.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.410
If I start at the origin, I
think about what is rho?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.450
So say this is a point on the
boundary of the sphere.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.690
I am going to start my rho
value-- whatever it is when it

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.930
hits the plane z equals 1--

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.580
and I'm going to stop
it when it hits the

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.380
boundary of this sphere.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.430
So my outer boundary for rho
is going to be this value.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.830
It's going to be determined
by phi, right?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.600
And now I have to determine
my inner boundary, right?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.540
And my inner boundary is
actually quite simple.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.630
It's a very simple
geometric thing.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.700
And so my inner boundary deals
with the fact that if this is

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.070
my plane z equals 1, and I look
at this triangle I make

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.300
right here.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.310
This angle down here, the bottom
angle is phi, and this

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.520
is a right angle, and the rho
value I'm interested in is

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.430
this hypotenuse, right?

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.090
I need to figure out what the
length of this is right here.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.480
And you can see it right away
from just the fact that phi is

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.360
this angle here, you get
rho is secant phi.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.600
So the bottom boundary comes
from just simple geometry.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.290
You get this length is 1 here.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.190
So you get rho is equal
to secant phi, right?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.040
This length here is 1, this is
the rho I'm interested in--

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.850
the blue part here-- and so rho
is equal to secant phi is

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.830
the lower bound.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.080
And it's equal to 2 cosine phi
at the upper bound, OK?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.270
And the thing I want to be
careful of is I'm not supposed

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.300
to include--

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.340
it won't matter for
the integral--

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.680
but I'm not supposed to
include the plane.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.440
Let me write this,
and make sure.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.220
Rho is going to be greater than
secant phi and it's going

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:03.230
to be less than or equal
to 2 cosine phi, right?

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.490
Right?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.170
So let me double-check and
make sure I didn't make a

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.650
geometry mistake here,
just to be sure.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.890
This picture tells me
that cosine phi is

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.740
equal to 1 over rho.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.250
That's good.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.160
So rho is equal to 1
over cosine phi.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.000
So I get secant phi there.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.550
So my rho values start at the
secant phi length and they go

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.960
to the 2 cosine phi length.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.310
I know maybe I'm beating a dead
horse here, but I want to

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.670
make sure we understand
where the rho

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.070
values are coming from.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.810
So actually, I have all
the bounds I need now.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.380
I have the theta bounds, and I
have the phi bounds, and the

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.590
rho bounds.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.020
Now you notice that theta and
phi don't depend on the other

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.680
variables, but rho
depends on phi.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.430
So we're going to have to
integrate that first. So now

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.900
we can deal with part b.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.630
Part b-- let's come back
over and remind

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.340
ourselves what it said--

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.890
said set up the integral for
the average distance of a

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.600
point in D from the origin.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.080
So I'm taking the average
value of a function.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.190
What is that function
I'm averaging?

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.810
How do I find the distance
from the origin?

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.753
Well, the distance from the
origin is a great function to

00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:09.540
have in spherical coordinates,
because it's just rho.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.560
So the function I'm supposed
to average over is the

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.880
function rho.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
In spherical coordinates,
that's the function.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.010
So let me write down what we're
going to have here.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:30.490
So in part b, the average
distance is going to equal 1

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.900
divided by the volume of D times
the triple integral over

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:44.000
D of the function rho dV, OK?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.740
So now I have to write dV in the
spherical coordinates, and

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.870
I have to write D in the
spherical coordinates bounds.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.120
And then I know I have to figure
out the volume of D. So

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.910
we're going to figure out each
of these things, and then

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.012
we'll be done.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:56.600
All right.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.650
So first, what is
the volume of D?

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.080
Well, the volume of D, let's
think about what it is.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.180
It's a sphere of radius 1.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:13.400
And so the volume of a sphere of
radius 1 is 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.740
And I want half of that.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.260
So I want 2/3.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.700
Since my radius is 1, I just
have to do 2/3 pi.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.980
So the first part is 1
divided by 2/3 pi.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.790
That's the volume of a
half-sphere of radius 1.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.040
And now let's integrate.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.110
I'll leave a little space
to write my bounds.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.080
I'm going to write the bounds
last, after I have everything

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.390
in order over here. dV is
rho squared sine phi d

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.490
rho d theta d phi.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:51.680
So I'm going to end up with a
rho cubed sine phi d rho d

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.750
theta d phi, right?

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:01.030
The dV gave me an extra rho
squared and a sine phi.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.350
That whole part is dV. And then
I keep one rho from the

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.100
fact that the distance
function is rho.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.380
And so I get a rho
cubed there.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.430
So hopefully that makes sense.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.980
Now for d rho, I know the bounds
are secant phi to 2

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.025
cosine phi.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:22.820
For d theta, my bounds
are 0 to 2 pi.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.930
And for d phi, my bounds
were 0 to pi over 4.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.180
I didn't make you evaluate it,
I'm just making you set it up.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.510
That actually is the solution
we wanted for part b.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.340
I wanted to average the distance
from any point in D

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.520
to the origin.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.890
So I just took the average value
of the function rho over

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.460
that region D. And so that's
how you finish that up.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.790
And so in this problem,
basically we want you to get

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.080
really familiar with how to do
some things in these spherical

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.860
coordinates, which are sometimes
a little hard to do.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.260
But if you noticed, what we were
doing in trying to figure

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.860
out the bounds-- in
particular, trying

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.150
to figure out rho--

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.970
we took what we knew in the x-,
y-, z-coordinates about

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.360
certain relationships, and then
we replaced the x-, y-,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.150
z-values by the values in terms
of rho and theta and

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.420
phi, and you can simplify to
figure out the relationships

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.510
you have between rho and
theta and phi for

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.410
the boundary value.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.900
So that was one of
the techniques

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.390
we were using there.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.430
And hopefully, the geometric
understanding of why these

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.130
angles go from 0 to 2 pi and
0 to pi over 4 is clear.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.580
And actually, the fact that this
is rho equals 2 cosine

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.020
phi should remind you of the
two-dimensional case where you

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.510
had some problem like r
equals 2 cosine theta.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.140
And that drew a circle
off-center from the origin.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.240
It's the analogous thing
happening here.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.490
Maybe I should stop there before
I say too many things.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.600
But again, the object of this
was just to get really

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.640
comfortable with spherical
coordinates, and I hope it's

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.100
helped you.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.700
I'll stop there.
