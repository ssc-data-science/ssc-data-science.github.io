00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,760
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,390
In this video what I'd like
you to do is use Green's

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,740
theorem to find the area
between one arch of the

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,080
cycloid that is described by x
equals a times the quantity

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,450
theta minus sine theta, y equals
a times the quantity 1

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,450
minus cosine theta,
and the x-axis.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,910
So probably it's helpful for you
to draw a picture of this

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,280
first. So you have one arch of
the cycloid defined in terms

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,060
of theta, the x of theta and y
of theta are here, and then

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,060
the x-axis will be
the other bound.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,780
And the big thing I want you to
notice is you're going to

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,100
use Green's theorem
to find the area.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,920
So why don't you pause the
video, work on the problem,

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,950
when you're ready to see my
solution you can bring the

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,200
video back up.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,880

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,990
OK, welcome back.

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,570
So again, what we want to do
is we want to use Green's

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,870
theorem to find an area.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,970
OK, and what I'm going to do
first is I'm going to try and

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,740
figure out what the picture
looks like and then I'm going

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,860
to figure out how
to use Green's

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,450
theorem in this region.

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,060
So lets first draw a sketch
of the picture of

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,020
what's going on.

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,070
And because I want the area
between one arch of the

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,960
cycloid and the x-axis, what I
really want to do first is

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
figure out what theta values
will make y positive, or

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,580
greater than or equal to
0, and go from there.

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,380
So if I want y to be greater
than or equal to 0, then what

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,560
I need is 1 minus cosine
theta to be greater

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,390
than or equal to 0.

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,790
And that's going to happen for
every theta from 0 to 2 pi,

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,200
and at 0 and 2 pi I get 0.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,890
So we know we want theta to
go between 0 and 2 pi.

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,510
Those are good parameters to
have for theta because this

38
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,240
statement is always true, but
I get 0 when theta is 0 and

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,500
when theta is 2 pi.

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,905
So I'm going to let theta
run between 0

41
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,490
and 2 pi, as I mentioned.

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,870
So now let's think about
what the picture is.

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,685
When theta is 0, if I come
over to what x is, x is a

44
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:12,380
times 0 minus 0.

45
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,600
So x is 0 and y we said was 0.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,380

47
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,560
I know that I'll achieve a
maximum height at theta equal

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,110
pi because that's where cosine
theta is minus 1.

49
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,440
So the 1 minus cosine
theta is 2.

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,230
And so if you look at what the
y value will be, the y value

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,000
when theta is pi is 2a.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,850
And the value is going to be
a times pi minus sine pi.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, sine of pi is 0.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,270
So I just get a pi.

55
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,790
So I should go over a pi.

56
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,670
And I know there's a point
at a pi, comma, I

57
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,920
think I said 2a.

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,550

59
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,590
And then it's actually going
to come back down the same

60
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,330
way, so let me draw
the first part.

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,870
This is not a perfect
drawing of this.

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't have lots of points.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,030
I'm having the smallest amount
of points possible to figure

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,190
out what's happening.

65
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,360
So then when theta is 2 pi,
1 minus cosine theta is 0.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,770
So I get y equals 0.

67
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,020
And then here I get 2 pi
minus sine of 2 pi.

68
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,640
Sine of 2 pi is 0,
so I get 2 pi a.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,290
So I come all the way over
here and I get 2 pi a.

70
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,110

71
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah, that's not maybe the most
beautiful picture, but

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,480
it's a good start.

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,490
So I'm interested in finding
the area of this region.

74
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,790
What I want to do then is, to
find the area of that region

75
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,650
I'm going to use Green's
theorem.

76
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,260
That's what we asked
you to do.

77
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,220
So what I want to do is I want
to pick a curve that's going

78
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,110
to have 2 components.

79
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,630
It's going to have C1, will be
this bottom part, and C2 will

80
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,670
be this top part.

81
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,240
And we need to keep it oriented
so when I'm walking

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,800
along the curve the region
is on the left.

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
And then I have to figure out
how to use Green's theorem.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,250
So to find the area of this
region, all I actually need is

85
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,610
the integral over the
region of dA.

86
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,270
That would give me the area.

87
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,520
And so what quantities--

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,260

89
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,300
what functions would be good?

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,940
Sorry.

91
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,330
In order to find this.

92
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,930
Well, I believe you actually
saw in class that

93
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,670
you have two options.

94
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:28,990
You have minus y dx over the
closed curve, or you have x dy

95
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,680
over the closed curve.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,320
You have one of those
two options.

97
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,050
Now which one of those is
better in this case?

98
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,950
We have a choice so let's
make the best choice.

99
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,470
Which one of those is better?

100
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,040
Well, if you notice that on
these two curves x is changing

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,180
on both of them but y is
fixed on this one.

102
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,090
So it'd be nicer for us if we
could just integrate on the

103
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,340
curve on this part, which we
would be able to do if we were

104
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,510
choosing this one.

105
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,790
Because y is constant and it
is equal to 0 along here.

106
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,810
So what you need to do to solve
this problem is really

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,410
you only need to integrate
on C2 minus y dx.

108
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,010
That's going to give you
the entire area.

109
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,390
And so now we have to figure out
how to put everything in.

110
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,430
Well, C2--

111
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,940
I'm parameterized in theta--

112
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,580
and C2 parameterized in
theta, if I start here

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,340
I'm at 2 pi for theta.

114
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,390
And if I go this direction
I'm at 0 for theta.

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,620
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do something that

116
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,930
might seem tricky, but
it's quite natural.

117
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,030
I'm going to replace this
minus by a plus and then

118
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,590
integrate from 0 to 2 pi.

119
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,570
Because I was going to be
integrating from 2 pi to 0 and

120
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,430
so I just flipped the order
and made that sign a plus.

121
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,690
So that should be fine.

122
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,450
And then y, I already
know what it is.

123
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,990
It's a times 1 minus
cosine theta.

124
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,250
And now I just have to figure
out what is dx.

125
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,370
So we have to come back over,
for one second we're going to

126
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,980
come over here and we're
going to look at dx.

127
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,370
If x is equal to a times theta
minus sine theta, then dx is

128
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,590
just a times 1 minus
cosine theta.

129
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,240
So that's nice because that's
actually what we already have.

130
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,510
So we come back over here--

131
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,790
oh, I should say also
with a d theta--

132
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,210
come back over here, dx gives
you a squared a, it gives you

133
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,560
a squared this, and it
gives you a d theta.

134
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,640
So that actually gives you
everything you need.

135
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,560
Now I am not going to actually
write out all the steps in

136
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,810
order to do this.

137
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,030
But the way you could easily do
this, you can pull out the

138
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,140
a squared and you're
left with a 1 minus

139
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,980
cosine theta squared.

140
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,540
You might think about squaring
all the terms and then you

141
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,990
have 1 cosine squared
theta to deal with.

142
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,340
But ultimately, when you
get your answer--

143
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,290
I'm just going to write
down what it is--

144
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,180
you get 3 pi a squared.

145
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,840
And you'll see you get a little
bit of cancellation and

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,460
it's not too hard to solve
at this point.

147
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,290
Since it's single variable
I'm going to assume I

148
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,500
don't need to do it.

149
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,980
But you can check your
final answer.

150
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,020
You should get--

151
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,720
I think, yes.

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,740
I got 3 pi a squared.

153
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,725
So what we did was we took a
problem, again, where we had a

154
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:16,040
curve defined in
terms of theta.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,270
We had a curve, and x and y, it
was parameterized in theta.

156
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,340
And we wanted to find
an area between that

157
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,000
curve and the x-axis.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
And the reason we could use
Green's theorem so easily is

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,350
because area of a region--

160
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,050
of this connected region
here-- is equal to the

161
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,930
integral over the closed loop
surrounding it of minus y dx,

162
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,060
or alternatively you could
have done x dy.

163
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,200
And because I got to choose,
I picked the easier one.

164
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,300
And I picked the easier one in
this case because y is equal

165
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,270
to 0 on one part of the curve.

166
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,140
So I just ignored the C1 because
that's where y is 0,

167
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,150
and I looked along C2.

168
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,520
I noticed C2 is parameterized
in this direction from theta

169
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,080
equals 2 pi to theta equals 0.

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,320
So that's why I dropped the
minus sign and changed

171
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,700
it from 0 to 2 pi.

172
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,150
That's where that came from.

173
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,270
And then you end up having to
just determine what y is and

174
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,140
what dx are, in terms
of theta.

175
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,660
Which we had them already in
terms of theta, so we could

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,840
just explicitly determine
everything, do all the

177
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,270
substitution and then evaluate
the integral.

178
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,750
So then, that's all there
is to this problem.

179
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,140
So hopefully that taught
you a little more

180
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,700
about Green's theorem.

181
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,110
And actually, now you've done
problems going from the left

182
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,750
to the right and from the
right to the left.

183
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,200
So you've done a little
bit of both.

184
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
So hopefully this revealed a
little bit more to you than

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,980
you knew before.

186
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,620
That's where I'll stop.

187
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:35,982
