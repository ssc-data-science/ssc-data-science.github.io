JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,710
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,545
In lecture, you've been learning
about line integrals

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,560
of vector fields.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,090
And I have one problem here that
requires you to do two

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,080
line integrals of vector
fields on that subject.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,630
So OK.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,250
So in both problems, F is going
to be the vector field

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,070
of whose coordinates are xy and
x squared plus y squared.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,700
And C is going to be the arc
of the parabola y equals x

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,100
squared that starts at the point
1, 1 and ends at the

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,670
point 2, 4.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,350
All right?

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,500
So what I'd like you to do is
to compute the integral over

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,520
this curve C of F.dr in
two different ways.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,680
So the first time, I'd like
you to use the natural

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,570
parametrization x equals
t, y equals t squared.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,950
For me, at least, that's the
first parametrization that I

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,810
think of when I think
about this curve.

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,060
But I'd also like you to do
it again using a different

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,310
parametrization, using the
parametrization x equals e to

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,090
the t, y equals e to the 2t.

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,490
So this still parametrizes the
curve y equals x squared,

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,830
since e to the t squared
equals e to the 2t.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,410

27
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,040
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at computing

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,750
this integral using these two
different parametrizations,

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,520
come back, and we can work
it out together.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,650

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,290
So let's get started.

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,740
We want to compute a line
integral of a vector field F.

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:52,820
So we know that the integral
over our curve C of F.dr--

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,120
well, usually we write--

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,800
F equals M, N. The two
components are M and N. So in

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,400
this case, this is going to be
equal to the integral over C

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,270
of M dx plus N dy.

38
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,700
Now, in our case, we
know what F is.

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,360
We know that F is the
vector field xy, x

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,770
squared plus y squared.

41
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:23,910
So this is equal to the integral
over C of xy dx, plus

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,400
x squared plus y squared dy.

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
And now we just need to plug
in for our two different

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,050
cases, into our
parametrizations, and this

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,500
will turn into an integral
that we can evaluate.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,050
So let's have a look-see.

47
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,090
So in our first parametrization
over here, we

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,970
have x equals t and y
equals t squared.

49
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,050
And we want this parametrization
to go from the

50
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,240
points 1, 1 to the point 2, 4.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,110
So that means that t--

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,680
x--

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,260
t is going from 1 to 2.

54
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,510
OK.

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,680

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,290
So I'm going to just write
equals, and continue on.

57
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,490
So in this first part, t is our
parameter, and it's going

58
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,320
from 1 to 2.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:28,400
So xy is going to be t times
t squared, and dx is dt.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,710
And then plus--

61
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,170
so x squared plus
y squared is--

62
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,000
t squared plus t
to the fourth.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,720
And dy is times 2t dt,
since y is t squared.

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,430
All right.

65
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,790
So this is our integral.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,360
And now it's straightforward
to compute.

67
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,820
This is single variable integral
of a polynomial, so

68
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,900
we might have some fraction
arithmetic in our future, but

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,610
nothing horrible.

70
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,210
So let's collect our dt's.

71
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,520
So this is the integral
from 1 to 2.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,900
So here I've got 2t cubed
plus 2t to the fifth.

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,960
And here I have t cubed.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:19,020
So that's 3t cubed plus
2t to the fifth dt.

75
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,970
OK, and so now we have
to evaluate.

76
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,480
So this is equal to-- let
me just continue it.

77
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:33,630
So 3t cubed becomes 3t
to the fourth over 4.

78
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,630
Plus 2t to the fifth becomes--

79
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,140
well, t to the sixth over 6--

80
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,470
2t to the sixth over 6, so
that's-- plus t to the sixth

81
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,420
over 3, between t
equals 1 and 2.

82
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,940
And let me just bring that
computation up here.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:05:06,790
So that's equal to 3 times 16
over 4, plus 64 over 3, minus

84
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,200
3/4 plus 1/3.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
OK, and now we gotta
work this out.

86
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,950
So this is maybe 12, and the
thirds give me 21, so that's

87
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,010
33 minus 3/4.

88
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:31,030
So that's 32 and 1/4, or 129
over 4, if you prefer.

89
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,300
OK, so that's going to
be our answer there.

90
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,790
So now let's go back and do it
again using this alternate

91
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,300
parametrization.

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,480
So in this alternate
parametrization, we had x

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,710
equal e to the t, and
y equal e to the 2t.

94
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:54,535
So in that case, that means that
dx --also x is e to the t

95
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:55,740
y equals 2t-- so our integral
that we want,

96
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,870
let me rewrite it.

97
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,130
Well, actually, let
me not rewrite it.

98
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,220
Let me just go back here
and take a look at it.

99
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,610
So we want the integral of F.dr,
and we know that that's

100
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,790
equal to the integral over C of
xy dx plus x squared plus y

101
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,280
squared dy.

102
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,560
So x is e to the t, y is e to
the 2t, so that means dx is

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,870
going to be e to the t dt
and dy is going to be

104
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,680
2e to the 2t dt.

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,150
So OK.

106
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,070
So we'll just have to plug
these things in.

107
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,770
So our integral--

108
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,630
maybe I'll give it a
name: What We Want.

109
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:35,400

110
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,950
WWW.

111
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,550
What We Want is equal to the
integral of, well we start

112
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,050
plugging in.

113
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:50,550
So xy dx is e to the t times e
to the 2t times, we said dx is

114
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,460
e to the t dt.

115
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,090
Plus, now x squared
plus y squared, so

116
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,080
that's e to the 2t--

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,170
that's x squared, plus
e to the 4t--

118
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,690
that's y squared--

119
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,920
times 2e to the 2t dt.

120
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,926
That's dy.

121
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:13,390
Whew.

122
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,360
OK.

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,890
But this integral is missing
something, right?

124
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,780
Because it needs to be
a definite integral.

125
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,600
Right now, I've written down
an indefinite integral.

126
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,730
So that's a problem.

127
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,190
So we need to think, what are
the bounds on this curve?

128
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,150
What are we integrating
from and to?

129
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,680
So let's go all the way
back and look at the

130
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,310
problem over here.

131
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,050
So this is the parametrization
of the curve, and we need it

132
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,250
to connect the points
1, 1 and 2, 4.

133
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,230
So we need to know which value
of t puts this parametrization

134
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,210
at the point 1, 1, and which
value of t puts it at the

135
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,590
point 2, 4.

136
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,270
Well, I think the easiest way
to do that is to solve this,

137
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,200
and we have t equals
natural log of x.

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,440
So natural log of 1 is 0,
and natural log of 2 is

139
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,730
natural log of 2.

140
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,030
So OK.

141
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,350
So we want t to go from
0 to natural log of 2.

142
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,880
To go from this point
to that one.

143
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,580
OK, so 0 to natural log of 2.

144
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's remember that, and
come back over here

145
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,770
and put that in.

146
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,490
So we want this integral that
we're trying to compute using

147
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,550
this alternate parametrization--

148
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,830
we've already written down
what the integrand is--

149
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,370
but it's going to be the
integral, we just said, from 0

150
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,840
to the natural log of 2.

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,570

152
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,280
OK.

153
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,730
Great.

154
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,710
So now let's take this integral
and let's start

155
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,220
simplifying it.

156
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,540
So let's see.

157
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,070
This is an e to the t times e to
the 2t times e to the t, so

158
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,820
that's e to the 4t dt.

159
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,960
And here we have--

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,680
that looks like-- a 2e to the
4t plus 2e to the 6t dt.

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,290
So if we combine like terms, we
get the integral from 0 to

162
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,470
natural log of 2.

163
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,590
So we had an e to the 4t and a
2e to the 4t, so that's 3e to

164
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:12,710
the 4t plus 2e to the 6t dt.

165
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,570
OK, 3e to the 4t plus
2e to the 6t.

166
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,080
OK.

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,590
And this is also a
different-looking integral

168
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,850
than the one we had before, but
it's not a difficult one

169
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,380
to evaluate, because it's just
e to a constant times t dt.

170
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,350
Pretty straightforward
stuff, I think.

171
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,720
So what does it actually
give us?

172
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,370
Let me come up here and
write it up here.

173
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,310
So this is equal to--

174
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,720
all right, integrate
e to the 4t--

175
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,040
and you get e to the 4t over 4,
so this is 3/4 e to the 4t,

176
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,010
plus 2/6, so that's plus 1/3
e to the 6t, and we're

177
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,630
evaluating that between
0 and ln 2.

178
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,730
And I will leave it to you to
confirm that what you get when

179
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,740
you do this is you get exactly
129 over 4 when you plug in

180
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,950
these values and take
the difference.

181
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,360
So one thing to notice here is
that doing it with the second

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,710
parametrization, we
got 129 over 4.

183
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,775
Now, if you look back just right
here, you see that when

184
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,370
we did it with the first
parametrization, we also got

185
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,150
129 over 4.

186
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,300
Now this is a general
phenomenon, right?

187
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,120
The parametrization
doesn't change the

188
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
value of the line integral.

189
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,370
So when you have a line integral
of a vector field,

190
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,790
you can parametrize the curve
that you're integrating over

191
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,950
in a bunch of different ways.

192
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,260
I mean, in fact, infinitely
many different ways.

193
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,170
There are all sorts of different
choices, and they

194
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,310
all give the same answer.

195
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,280
They have to.

196
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,470
So no matter what
parametrization you choose,

197
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,240
you get the same number out for
the line integral over the

198
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,440
same curve of the same
vector field.

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,790
All right.

200
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,505
So what that means for you is
that when you're given just a

201
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,870
curve and a vector field and
you get to choose your

202
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,010
parametrization, you should
always just choose whatever

203
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,910
the nicest one is.

204
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,770
Because it doesn't matter which
one you choose, and

205
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,070
there's no reason
ever to choose

206
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,250
anything harder than necessary.

207
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,280
All right.

208
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,040
So now, I want to quickly
recap what we did.

209
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,560
So we had a curve and a vector
field F, and we were asked to

210
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,740
compute the line integral of
F.dr, and we did it two

211
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,050
different ways.

212
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,340
So in both cases, we used
the fact that F.dr

213
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,080
is M dx plus N dy.

214
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,160
We wrote that out using the
known values of M and N, and

215
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,950
using the known components of F.
And then we plugged in for

216
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,530
both cases.

217
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,600
In this case, we used that
first parametrization.

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,270
And then over to my left,
we used this second

219
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,610
parametrization that
I gave you.

220
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,180
And in both cases, that reduced
it to an integral in

221
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,220
terms of a single variable t
that was the parameter that we

222
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,880
could compute.

223
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,250
And the answer came out the same
both times, as it had to.

224
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,190
So one thing you can notice is
if you compare this with the

225
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,880
preceding lecture video, you'll
see that this curve and

226
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,010
vector field, they connect the
same points and it's the same

227
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,760
vector field, and these answers
both differ from both

228
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,620
of the answers in the preceding
recitation video.

229
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,090
So this is further illustration
that different

230
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,520
curves can give you different
values, but if you take the

231
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,350
same curve, different
parametrizations always have

232
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,980
to give you same values for that
line integral of the same

233
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,940
vector field.

234
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,630
I'll end there.

235
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,218
