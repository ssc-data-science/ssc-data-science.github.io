00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,860
DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,651
Today the problem I'd
like to work with you

3
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:14,950
is about computing
partial derivatives

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,930
and the total differential.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,760
So we have a function z which
is x squared plus y squared.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,100
So it depends on the
two variables x and y.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,890
Now the variables
x and y themselves

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,210
depend on two auxiliary
variables, u and v.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,520
So that's the
setup that we have.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,500
So in part a, we just want to
compute the total differential

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,420
dz in terms of dx and dy.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,220
So u and v aren't going
to enter into the picture.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,580
And then in part b,
we're going to compute

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,470
the partial derivative
partial z partial u

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,270
in two different ways.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,270
First, we're going to compute
it using the chain rule.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,940
And then we're going to compute
it using total differentials.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,380
And so we'll substitute
in some of the work

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,610
that we had in a
to solve that part.

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,690
So why don't you pause the video
now and work on the problem.

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,440
We'll check back and
we'll do it together.

22
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:16,480
Hi, and welcome back.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,230
Let's get started.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,130
So first, computing
a is not so bad.

25
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:27,030
So we just need
to first remember,

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,980
what does it mean to compute
the total differential?

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,170
So the total
differential dz is just

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,830
the partial derivative of z
in the x-direction dx plus

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,670
z in the y-direction dy.

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,430
OK?

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,250
So now, looking at our
formula here for z,

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,900
we have-- so the
partial derivative of z

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,020
in the x-direction is
2x, so this is 2x dx.

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,466
And the partial derivative
of z in the y is 2y,

35
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:05,860
so we have 2y dy.

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,310
OK, and that's all
we have to do for a.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,310
Now for b, we want to compute
this partial derivative

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,510
in two different ways.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,780
First, using the chain rule.

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,910
So let's remember what
the chain rule says.

41
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,360
So whenever I think
about the chain rule,

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,666
I like to draw this
dependency graph.

43
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,165
OK?

44
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,040
And this is just a
way for me to organize

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,150
how the different variables
depend on one another.

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,270
So at the top, we have z.

47
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:47,620
And z is a function of
x and y, but x is itself

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,000
a function of both u
and v, and y is also

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,490
a function of u and v.
So z depends on x and y,

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,380
and x and y each jointly
depend on u and v.

51
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,770
So it's a little
bit complicated,

52
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,540
the relationships here.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,620
So now, what the
chain rule says is

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,620
that if we take a partial
derivative-- partial z

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,250
partial u-- we have to go
through our dependency graph.

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,020
Every way that we
can get from z to u,

57
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,980
we get a term in our summation
for each one of those.

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,240
So for instance, z
goes to x goes to u.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,420
So that means that we
have partial z partial x,

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,130
partial x partial u.

61
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,470
And then we can also go
z goes to y goes to u.

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:51,000
And that will give us partial z
partial y, partial y partial u.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,380
And now these partials
are ones that we can just

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,590
compute from our formulas.

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,220
So for instance,
partial z partial x

66
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,820
is 2x, which we computed.

67
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,710
Now partial x partial u, we have
to remember that x is defined

68
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,770
as u squared minus v squared.

69
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,570
And so partial x
partial u, that's 2u.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,280
Partial z partial y, again,
is this 2y that we computed.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,360
And partial y partial u is v.
This v is just because u was

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,980
u*v, and we take a partial
in the u-direction.

73
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,480
OK.

74
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:48,510
So altogether this
is 4u*x plus 2v*y,

75
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,410
and that's our
partial derivative.

76
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,500
So notice that, you know,
x is a function of u and v.

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,780
So if I really wanted
to, I could substitute

78
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,483
for x its formula for
u and v, but that's not

79
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,191
really necessary.

80
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,940
You know, what's interesting
about these problems is

81
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,360
how the differentials
depend on one another,

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,410
and I'm perfectly happy
with an answer that

83
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,870
has mixed variables like this.

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,070
That's fine.

85
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,470
So now, let's go
over here and let's

86
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,440
see if we can get the
same answer by using

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,910
total differentials.

88
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,210
Now, I have to say
that the chain rule

89
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,450
that we used on the
previous problem,

90
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,620
it's the quickest way to
do these sorts of things.

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,250
I like to do total differentials
if I have some time

92
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,750
to actually explore the problem
and get comfortable with it.

93
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,007
I prefer to use total
differentials because I think

94
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,090
it's a little bit clearer.

95
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,520
Somehow, this chain
rule it's just, to me,

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,090
it's just a prescription,
it's not an explanation.

97
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,330
So why don't we compute
some total differentials.

98
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,060
So we already saw-- let
me just repeat over here.

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,630
We already saw that dz
is 2x dx plus 2y dy.

100
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,600
OK.

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,245
Now, we want to
use the fact that x

102
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,780
is itself a function of
u and v. So that's what

103
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,700
we need to do now.

104
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:33,660
So that tells us that dx is 2u
du minus 2v dv in the same way.

105
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,630
And dy.

106
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,110
So remember, y was u*v.
So taking d of u*v,

107
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,170
we get v du plus u dv.

108
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,870
OK?

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,540
So now, so what we've
done is we've just

110
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,870
listed out all of the
total differentials.

111
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,730
And the nice thing about
this is once you've

112
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,860
done these computations,
now it's just substitution.

113
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,950
So what we really want
to know is how does z

114
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,180
depend on u and v. And
so all we need to do

115
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,880
is substitute in our
formulas for dx here.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,240
So this tells us
that dz is-- OK,

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,020
so we have 2x-- instead of
dx, we just plug in here--

118
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:30,820
so we have 2u du minus 2v dv.

119
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,830
So that was this term.

120
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,990
And now we have
plus 2y-- and now

121
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,791
we just plug in this--
so v du plus u dv.

122
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,290
You see?

123
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,779
It's just substitution.

124
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,570
So then now, we just
expand everything out.

125
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,570
And so we get-- OK,
so let's collect

126
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,020
all the things involving du.

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,850
So if we collect all the
things involving du, we have--

128
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:15,890
2 times 2 times x times
u-- 4x*u plus 2y*v.

129
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,240
This whole quantity times du.

130
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,000
And then if we collect the
terms in dv, we have 2y*u.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:42,700
So that's coming from here, and
then we have a minus 4x*v. OK?

132
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,550
And now what that tells
us is that-- so let's

133
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,940
just remember that
one definition

134
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,480
of the partial derivative
partial z partial u

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,350
is this coefficient.

136
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,740
So if I go over here, if we
write the total differential

137
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:11,000
dz, we can write that as
partial z partial u du

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,920
plus partial z partial v dv.

139
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,280
Right?

140
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,930
Well, look.

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,830
What we have here
on these two sides

142
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,500
is essentially the
same expression.

143
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,090
So that means if
we want to compute

144
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,590
partial z partial u, then that's
just equal to this coefficient

145
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,300
here.

146
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,150
So we get that partial z
partial u is 4x*u plus 2--

147
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,810
that should be v.
One of those is an x.

148
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,320
Let's see.

149
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,650
So where did this come from.

150
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,590
Yeah, one of those
is an x, sorry--

151
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,570
SPEAKER 1: It's a y.

152
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,110
DAVID JORDAN: --is a y.

153
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,130
2v*y, OK.

154
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,950
Now just as a sanity
check, why don't we

155
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,620
go back to the
middle of the board,

156
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,200
and we'll see that we
got the same thing.

157
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,350
So 4x*u plus 2v*y, that's what
we concluded for partial z

158
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,000
partial u.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,740
And then going back to the
middle of the board, that's we

160
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,620
found again.

161
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,690
So let's just go over
the two different methods

162
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,510
and compare them.

163
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,420
So if I'm in a rush to
do a computation-- maybe

164
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,610
I'm taking an
exam-- I definitely

165
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,160
think it's the quickest
to just compute,

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,600
to figure out what the
dependency of the variable is,

167
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,380
and I use this dependency graph.

168
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,620
And then I just trace
all the paths from z

169
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,260
to the independent variable
u that I'm interested in.

170
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,070
And then I multiply all
the partial derivatives

171
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,570
that correspond to each edge
and I get an expression.

172
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,230
Now if I have more
time, then I really

173
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,630
prefer to use the method
of total differentials

174
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,290
that we did on the third board.

175
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,981
I like it, because once you
do some simple calculus,

176
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,765
and then after that it's
just, it's basic algebra.

177
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,520
I find that I'm
less likely to make

178
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
a mistake doing that method.

179
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,724
But as you saw, it
involves computing

180
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,640
a lot more derivatives
that we didn't actually

181
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,800
use in the final answer.

182
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,740
For instance, when we
computed total differentials,

183
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,679
we got an expression
for partial z partial v

184
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,220
at the end of the
day, even though we

185
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,261
weren't asked to do that.

186
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,140
So it's lengthier, but I
think more conceptually

187
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,360
straightforward.

188
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,860
So I think I'll
leave it at that.
