JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,020
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,170
In lecture, you've been learning
about critical points

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,960
of functions, how to find them
using the first derivatives

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,900
and how to classify them using
the second derivative test. So

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,340
I have a question here
for you about that.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,060
So we have a function w.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,300
It's a function of two variables
x and y, and it's

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,760
given by this polynomial
function of them.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,330
So w equals x cubed minus
3xy plus y cubed.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,580
So what I'd like you to do is
to first find the critical

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,980
values of this function and
then classify them.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,890
Are they minima or maxima or
saddle points using the second

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,070
derivative test?

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,850
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,050
to work that out.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,520
Come back and we can work
it out together.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:57,050

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,440
Hopefully, you had some luck
working out the solution to

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,270
this question.

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,440
Let's have a go at it.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,660
So in order to find the critical
points, we need to

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,820
look at the first derivative.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,650
So the critical points are the
points where both partial

25
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,130
derivatives or all partial
derivatives, if we had a

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,470
function of more variables,
are equal to zero.

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,090
So we need to look at
the first partials.

28
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,800
So the first partials here,
w sub x, the partial with

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,510
respect to x, well, it's just
a polynomial so it's easy to

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,200
compute those partial
derivatives.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,080
It's going to be 3x squared
minus 3y, and then the last

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,820
term gets killed because we
treat y as a constant, and so

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,780
we want that to be
equal to zero.

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,750
And similarly, we want the first
partial with respect to

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,180
y, w sub y, to be
equal to zero.

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:50,750
And so that's minus 3x plus
3y squared equals 0.

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,380
Now, luckily, these are fairly
simple equations, so to solve

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,780
them, we could, for example,
take the first equation and we

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,370
could solve the first equation
for y in terms of x.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,900
So that'll give us y
equals x squared.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,910
And now if we plug y equals
x squared into this second

42
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,820
equation, well, we get minus
3x plus 3x squared squared.

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,290
So that's x to the fourth is
equal 0, and we can divide out

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,020
by that 3, so that means
minus x plus x to the

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,130
fourth equals 0.

46
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, OK, so we could have x
equal to 0, or you can divide,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then you get x cubed
equals 1, and that has

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
solution x equals 1.

49
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,480
So x equals 0 or 1.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,470
Those are the only solutions
to this equation.

51
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,880
And then the corresponding
y-values, well, we know y is

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:47,880
equal to x squared, so this
gives us critical points when

53
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,150
x is 0, y is 0 and when
x is 1, y is 1.

54
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,600
So this function has
two critical

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
points: 0, 0 and 1, 1.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
Now we need to figure out
whether those critical points

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,250
are minima, maxima,
saddle points, sum

58
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,150
of several of those.

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,630
So in order to do that, we're
going to use this nice tool

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,330
that we have: the second
derivative test. So in order

61
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,650
to apply the second derivative
test, the first thing I need

62
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,300
is the second derivatives.

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,620
So let's compute them.

64
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,750
So the second--

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,330
let's do the xx first. So we
take our first partial, 3x

66
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,720
squared minus 3y, and we take
another partial of it with

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,350
respect to x.

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,580
So that's, in this case, that's
just going to be 6x.

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:41,210
And then we've got the other
pure second partial yy, so we

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,910
go back over here, and we look
at what our first partial wy

71
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,630
was, and then we take another
partial of this with respect

72
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,620
to y, so that's just
going to be 6y.

73
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,490
And then we have the mixed
partials wxy and wyx, which,

74
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,150
of course, are equal to each
other whenever our function is

75
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,490
nicely behaved like
a polynomial.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,550
So wxy, we just take the two
mixed partials and--

77
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,790
OK, so we take the partial of
wx with respect to y, for

78
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,270
example, and that gives
us minus 3.

79
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,050
So these are our three partials,
and then often, we,

80
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,120
you know, call this one A and
this one C and this one B. I

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,410
guess I kind of mixed up the
order a little bit there.

82
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,070
So we look at these three
expressions, and now we want

83
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,280
to look at what sometimes people
call the discriminant,

84
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
although I don't know
if Professor

85
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,950
Auroux used that term.

86
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:43,870
So we want to study what the
expression AC minus B squared

87
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,540
is, so we want to know is this
positive, is this negative at

88
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,320
the critical points.

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,270
So at the critical
points, right?

90
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,840
This is important.

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,280
At the critical points.

92
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:07,410
So let's do the point 1, 1
first. So at 1, 1, we have A

93
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,370
is equal to what we put in--
x is 1, y is 1 into the

94
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,870
expression for A here--

95
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,580
and that just gives a 6.

96
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,250
We put x 1, y 1 into the
expression for C, and that

97
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,095
also gives a 6, we put x 1, y
1 into the expression for B,

98
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:22,750
and that gives us minus 3.

99
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:33,730
So A is 6, B is minus 3, C is
6, so AC minus B squared is

100
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:41,452
equal to, well its equal to
36 minus 9, so that's 27.

101
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:45,810
And, in particular,
it's positive.

102
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,190
So when this is positive, that
means we either have a maximum

103
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,780
or a minimum.

104
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,200
So in order to figure out
whether we have a maximum or a

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,940
minimum, we check the sign of
A. So in this case, the sign

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,715
of A is positive.

107
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,260
A is a positive number.

108
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,950

109
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,630
So when you have that AC minus B
squared is positive and A is

110
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,400
positive, that means
you have a minimum.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,850

112
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,730
So the critical point
1, 1 is a local

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,500
minimum for this function.

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,890
All right.

115
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:26,170
Now we can do the same thing for
the critical point 0, 0.

116
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:32,300
So recall A was 6x, so at 0,
0, A is equal to 0, B was

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,950
equal to negative 3 everywhere,
and C was equal to

118
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:41,540
6y, so at 0, 0, that's 6 times
0 so that's also 0.

119
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,520
So then our quantity that we
want to look at, AC minus B

120
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,310
squared, well, that's 0 times 0
minus 9, so that's equal to

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,680
negative 9.

122
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,200
And negative 9 is less than 0,
so when AC minus B squared is

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,899
less than 0, that means we
have a saddle point.

124
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:03,890

125
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,410
So in this case, the second
derivative test was able

126
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,490
successfully to distinguish what
kinds of critical points

127
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,180
we had, and it found that the
first critical point 1, 1 was

128
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,220
a minimum and that the second
critical point 0, 0 was a

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,270
saddle point.

130
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,650
So just to quickly rehash what
we did, we had a function.

131
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,050
Back over here, we started
with this function w.

132
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,190
We had a nice formula for it.

133
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,650
We computed its first
derivatives.

134
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,730
We set them both equal
to zero and we solved

135
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,380
that system of equations.

136
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,660
So we found two solutions to
that system of equations, and

137
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,020
those two solutions are the
critical points, the points

138
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,780
where both partial derivatives
are equal to zero.

139
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,440
So when you have the two
critical points, then you want

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,230
to apply the second derivative
test to figure out for each

141
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,390
critical point whether it's
a saddle point, a

142
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,000
minimum or a maximum.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,140
So we took our two critical
points 1, 1 and 0, 0, and at

144
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,280
those points, we evaluated
the second derivative.

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
So A is the xx second
derivative.

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,180
B is the mixed partial wxy,
and C is the yy second

147
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,170
derivative.

148
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,960
So we evaluate those expressions
at the points in

149
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,040
question, and then we look
at AC minus B squared.

150
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,840
And then the sign of AC minus
B squared, if it's negative,

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,720
that gives us a saddle point.

152
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,400
If it's positive, that gives
us either a maximum or a

153
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,340
minimum, and we check which one
by looking at the sign of

154
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,160
A. So here A was positive, so
we got a minimum at 1, 1.

155
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,060
So I'll stop there.

156
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,185
