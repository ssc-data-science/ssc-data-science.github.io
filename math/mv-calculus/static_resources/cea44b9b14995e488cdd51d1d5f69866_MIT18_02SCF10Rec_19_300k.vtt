DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.550
In this question, we're going
to be considering a contour

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.230
plot, which is given
to us as followed.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.010
The values are not indicated.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.830
So the first thing that
we want to do

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.880
is we want to identify--

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.850
on this contour plot, there is
a unique saddle point, and we

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.620
want to label that as point A,
and there are two points which

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.250
are either a maximum
or a minimum.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.280
We can't actually tell because
the labels aren't on this

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.930
contour plot, but we want to
go ahead and label those

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.870
anyways: B and C. So they're
either maximum or minimum, but

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.880
we can still find them and we
can still identify them.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.690
So that's the first part
of the problem.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.140
The second part is since this
doesn't have the values

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.680
entered onto the graph, we want
to consider what possible

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.400
configurations could we have?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:07.830
So the second question is: can
B and C both be maximal?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:22.975
And can we have B maximal
but C minimal?

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:24.225
OK.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.710
And then in each of these
two cases, we want to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.495
sketch the 3D graph.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.720
So why don't you take some
time to work this out.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260
Pause the video, and we'll check
back, and I'll show you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.510
how I solve this.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.530
Hello, and welcome back.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.830
So to get started, why don't we
answer the first question

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.630
by writing the points right
on our original graph.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.880
So I'll just come over here.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.520
Now, when we're looking for a
minimum or a maximum on a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.140
contour plot, you know, the
thing that we should keep in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
mind is that a minimal or a
maximal always is going to be

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.340
contained in concentric contours
that are either

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.890
approaching the minimum
from below or--

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.110
excuse me-- approaching the
maximum from below or the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.450
minimum from above.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.490
And so if we look here, we see
that these rings start to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.420
become concentric, and somewhere
in here, there's got

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.700
to be either a maximum
or a minimum.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.020
Because, you know, inside this
little region here, the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.640
function doesn't pass through
another contour plot, so we

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.130
have to find either a maximum
or a minimum inside the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.460
innermost ring.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.180
And similarly, we have to
find either a minimum

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.250
or a maximum here.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.850
So let's just call this one
B and this one C. OK.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.640
Now, we also have a saddle point
A in this problem, and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.550
it's a little bit hard to
see in the contour plot.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.450
I think it'll be a little even
clearer when we draw a 3D

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.710
graph, but basically what's
happening is the fact that you

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.540
have these contours--

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.830
so this contour is, after all,
the same as that contour.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.680
So the value of the function
here and here are the same,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.390
and yet, if we look at this
point and this point, the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.220
values, they'll either
go up or down.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.890
We don't know.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.690
Let's assume that they go up.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.940
So here, in this direction, the
values are going up, and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.150
in this direction, the values
are determined by this contour

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.560
curve, and so somewhere in
this middle region here,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.770
there's got to be
a saddle point.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.780
I think this'll be even clearer

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.440
when we draw our graph.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.370
So we have a saddle point
A in the middle there.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.400
And, in fact, this is really,
this is the general picture of

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.110
what a saddle point is
going to look like.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.800
It's going to be when you have
two either maxima or minima

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.900
rising out, and you have a
contour which is containing

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.500
the point in the middle.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.280
So those are our points A, B and
C that we're going to be

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.340
interested in.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.000
So now, the second question that
we have to consider is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.200
can B and C both be maximal?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.190
And the third question is can
B be maximal and C minimal?

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.110
And actually, we'll answer both
of these questions by

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.800
just sketching an example,
so that's how will we'll

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
understand this.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.160
So why don't we see if we can
sketch an example where B and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.410
C are both maximal.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.510
So here's the start of my graph
in three dimensions, and

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.900
if we want B and C to both be
maximal, then let me go ahead

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.501
and draw the contour lines
that we have. So we have,

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:20.840
first of all, we had this one,
and then we had another one,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.610
and then we had a peak, and
then we had a peak.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.710
So if we want to draw this in
three dimensions, then what we

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.790
just need to do is we just need
to follow these contour

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.550
plots up out of the plane
and into space.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.670
So this goes up, and then
there's a maximum, and then it

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.800
comes back down along the
contour lines, and then it

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.170
goes back up, and then
it goes back down.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.795
So that's just one of the curves
that lies on the graph

00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:55.020
of the function, but then we
need to flush out the contour

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.420
lines, which they look like
these sort of rings here.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.670
OK?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.270
And so, indeed, we do see that
it's possible for both B and C

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.860
to be a maximal.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220
Here's an example
of such a thing.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.500
And so here's our point B,
here's our point C, and as

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.420
promised, I think it's much
clearer now how A becomes a

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.510
saddle point.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.410
Because you have these two
mountains rising up, and the

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.260
valley in between them
is necessarily a

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.220
little saddle here.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.790
It increases in this
direction and it

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.290
decreases in this direction.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.350
Now, for the second one, we're
asked can B be maximal and yet

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.750
C be minimal?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.950
And the answer is still yes.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.700
And a nice way to think about
this problem, to think about

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.210
the graph that I'm going to
draw, is imagine that we start

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.690
over here and we dig a hole, and
as we're digging, we throw

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.660
the dirt over behind us.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.390
So we're going to have a hole,
a dip here, and then we're

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.230
going to pile that hole
up over here.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.280
And so then--now, notice that
both of these that I've drawn,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.710
if we don't label the contour
lines, these have the same

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.440
contour plot, because the
concentric rings on C, which

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.540
are telling us that the function
in increasing,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.110
they're the same below, because
this is essentially

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.610
the same thing.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.100
The concentric rings that on
this curve, on this surface,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.990
were telling us that B was a
maximal point, now the same

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.370
rings are telling us that
B is a minimal point.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.730
So this illustrates that a
contour plot is really--

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.270
doesn't tell you everything
about the graph unless you

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.950
actually label the values
of the contours.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.330
So here we see two examples
where the sort of global

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.960
behavior of B and C are very
different even though they

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.380
have the same contour plot.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.580
Now notice, in both cases,
A is a saddle point.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.520
It's increasing in
one direction and

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.710
decreasing in the other.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.840
And I think I'll leave
it at that.
