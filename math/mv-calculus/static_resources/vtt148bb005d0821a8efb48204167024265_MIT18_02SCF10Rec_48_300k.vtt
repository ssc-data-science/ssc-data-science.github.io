JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.570
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.790
In lecture, you've been learning
about two-dimensional

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.990
flux and the normal form of
Green's theorem, so normal

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.890
here meaning perpendicular.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.710
So I want to give you a
problem about that.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.710
So what I'd like you to do is
to verify Green's theorem in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.390
normal form for this particular
field, the field F

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.080
equals xi hat plus yj hat and
the curve C that consists of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.380
the upper half of the unit
circle and the x-axis

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.760
interval (-1, 1).

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.310
So first of all, let me say what
I mean by this C. So C,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.825
it's the usual unit circle,
circle of radius 1 centered at

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.040
the origin, so just its top
half, And the x-axis interval

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.500
(-1, 1), I mean, the line
segment that connects the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.510
points (-1, 0) and (1, 0),
so the diameter of that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.460
semicircle.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.340
So that's the curve
C and the field F.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.400
What I mean by verify Green's
theorem is I'd like you to

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.950
compute both the double integral
that appears in

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.050
Green's theorem and the line
integral that appears in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.690
Green's theorem and check
that they're really

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.700
equal to each other.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.950
So that'll confirm Green's
theorem in this particular

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.120
instance and hopefully help
give us a feel for how it

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.880
works a little bit.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.500
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go, compute both

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.060
of those integrals, come
back and we can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.670
work them out together.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.030
Hopefully you had some
luck with this.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.390
Let's have a go at it.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.010
So what Green's theorem tells
you is that the flux across a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
curve, which we usually compute
as a line integral, is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.850
also equal to an integral of the
divergence over the region

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.760
bounded by that curve.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.050
So here the curve has to be a
closed curve so that it bounds

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.960
a region of the plane.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.450
So in particular, let's draw
the picture here so we know

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.630
what we're talking about.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.270
So the curve C, so we've got the
segment from -1 to 1 along

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.240
the x-axis, and then
we have the top

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.490
half of the unit circle.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.820
That's the curve C. And I didn't
specify an orientation

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.440
but in any context like this,
when you don't specify an

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.650
orientation, what you mean
is positively oriented.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.880
So it's a positively
oriented curve.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.320
So that's our curve C.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.650
And so the region that it bounds
is this half of the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.210
circle, the semicircle.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.730
I keep saying half of
the semicircle.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.450
Sorry about that.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
This upper half of the circle,
of the disc, in fact.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.830
That region of the plane.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.360
OK, so what Green's theorem
tells us is that when we

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.270
compute the surface integral--

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.110
sorry, the double integral--

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.850
of the divergence of F over this
region, that should be

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.500
the same as what we do if we
compute F dot n around the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.860
boundary of the curve.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.540
And now we're going
to check it.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:31.770
So let's do the double integral
first. The double

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.130
integral in this case, so it's
the double integral over--

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.390
let me call that region R--

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.480
so it's the double integral
over R of the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.790
divergence of F dA.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.380
So what is the divergence
of F?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.650
Well, here's F. It's
xi hat plus yj hat.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.360
So it's divergence is the
partial of x with respect to

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.760
x, plus the partial of
y with respect to y.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.800
So that's 1 plus 1.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.990
So the divergence of F is
just 2, in this case.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.500
So it's equal to the double
integral over the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.570
semicircle of 2 dA.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.270
And of course when you integrate
a constant over a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.580
region, what you get is just
that constant times the area

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.330
of the region.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.420
So dA here is the area of the
semicircle, it's half of a

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.820
circle of radius 1.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.980
So circle of radius
1 has area pi.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.790
So this is 2 times 1/2 pi.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.720
So this is pi.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.010
OK.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.290
So that's the double integral
that we get from Green's

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.880
theorem in normal form.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.160
And what Green's theorem says
is that this is equal to a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.750
particular line integral.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.810
So what is the line integral?

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.110
Well, it's the integral
around C of F dot n.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.910
So let's write down what
it is, the line

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.770
integral part now.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.620
So it's an integral.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.940
It's a closed curve.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:20.100
So it's in and around
C of F dot n ds.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.580
So that is the line integral
that we're looking to compute.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.035
So how do we compute this?

00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:33.450
Well, usually we compute it by
using the coordinates of F. So

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.200
this is equal to, and we know
that this is always equal to,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.810
the integral around C of--

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.810
and let me make sure I'm getting
this right before I

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.680
screw anything up.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.020
Yes.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.690
OK, I am.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.270
Good.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.630
M dy minus N dx, where M and N
are the coordinates of F-- or

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.180
the components of F. M and N are
the components of F. So M

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.640
is the first component and N
is the second component.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.530
So in our case, F has this
fairly simple form.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.710
So in our case this is equal to
the integral around C of--

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.155
so M, the first component
of F is x.

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:20.120
So this is xdy minus the second
component is ydx.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.730
So this is the line integral
we're interested in computing.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.000
But, of course, this curve
is not easy to

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.720
parameterize as a single go.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.340
So we want to split it
into two pieces.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.710
So let's look.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.320
So the first piece we want
to split it into

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.700
is that line segment.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.590
So let's call that maybe--

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.890
well, I'm not even going to
bother giving them names.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.390
We want to split it into the
integral over the line segment

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.700
plus the integral over
the semicircle.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.430
The boundary of that--

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.040
yes, the semicircle.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.290
So this is equal to--

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.180
so it's the integral over
the line segment.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.730
So let's see.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.640
So that integral--

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.940
well, OK, I will give
them names.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.590
I will give them names.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.560
I take it back.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.490
We'll call the line segment
C1 and we'll call

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.930
the semicircle C2.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.310
So it's equal to the
integral over c1.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.760
OK, well, what is the
integral over c1?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.260
What are x and dy and y
and dx in this case?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.670
So in this case, well, x is
what we're integrating.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.820
But dy, we're on this line
segment, y isn't changing.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.110
y is constant.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.070
So dy is just 0.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.060
So it's 0 minus--

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.990
OK, and now on this line
segment y is 0 also.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.260
So it's 0dx.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.490
So the first integral, the
integral over C1, is the

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.870
integral of 0.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.160
Plus we have to integrate
over C2.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:57.000
Of OK, so x dy minus y dx.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.370
All right.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.250
So this one's just going
to be 0, that's easy.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.720
So now we just have to work
with this second one.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.030
OK, so for the second one, we're
integrating over the

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.130
semicircle so we want
to parameterize it.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.700
And we're going to use our
usual parameterization.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.340
x equals cosine t,
y equals sine t.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.710
And in this case, we just want
to do this semicircle.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.960
So we just want to go from
(1, 0) all the way

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.170
around to (-1, 0).

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.910
So that is from going
from 0 to pi.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.460
So this is equal to--

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.170
so this first integral
is just 0.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.430
It's the integral of
0 and that's 0.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.360
So it's the integral--

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.480
OK, so t is going to
go from 0 to pi.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.930
So now x dy.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.100
So x is cosine t.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.500
y is sine t.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.890
So dy is sine t dt.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.420
Sorry, it's cosine t dt.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.910
y is sine t.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.840
dy is cosine t dt.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.300
So it's cosine t times
cosine t dt minus.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.500
All right, now y is
sine t again.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.820
And x is cosine t.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.000
So dx is minus sine t dt.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.777
So this is times minus
sine t dt.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.140
OK, well what happens here?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.500
So this becomes cosine squared
t dt minus minus

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.930
sine squared t.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.930
Minus minus is plus.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.620
So it's cosine squared t dt
plus sine squared t dt.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.500
But, of course, cosine squared
plus sine squared is just 1.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.253
So we can write this even more
simply as the integral from 0

00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:43.660
to pi of 1 dt or just dt, and
the integral dt is just t.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.930
So this is t between 0
and pi, which is pi.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.380
Whew!

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.060
OK.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.040
Pi.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.490
Good.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.910
And what did we get before?

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.100
We also got pi.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.990
Great.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.760
So we have successfully verified
Green's theorem in

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.210
normal form in this particular
instance.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.990
So let's just recap
again what we did.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:10.310
We had this field F and this
curve C. This closed curve C

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.970
that bounded some region.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.130
And so what we've done is we
computed the double integral

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.850
over the region of d of F dA.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.480
So that's what we did first.
Double integral over the

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.140
region bounded by the curve.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.390
And then second we computed the
line integral around the

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.490
boundary of F dot n ds.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.430
So that was what-- this is
always a useful form in which

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.950
to write this F dot n dA.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.620
OK, and then we substituted
and computed it.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.560
And Green's theorem tells us
that the two intervals have to

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.600
be equal to each other.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.490
And indeed, for this particular
F and this

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.260
particular C, we verified
that in this case they

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.190
both give us pi.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.030
And, of course, Green's theorem
tells us that that

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.780
would have been true, that they
would have come out the

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.620
same, regardless of what the
choice of F and the choice of

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.620
C that we made were.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.490
So I'll stop there.
