DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.900
So the problem that I want to
work with you now is to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.470
compute some integrals, but we
want to compute them in the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560
presence of a density
function.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.610
So the region that we're
considering is very simple.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.830
It's just the unit square.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.540
So we have the origin here, we
have the line x equals 1, we

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.970
have the line y equals 1, and
we just want to compute in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.300
this region.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.760
And so we want to use this
density function to find

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.890
various sort of physical

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.500
characteristics of this region.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.740
So first, we want to find its
mass, and so we are going to

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.380
need to recall how you get
mass from density.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.210
We want to find the
center of mass.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.190
That is, where is the point on
which we could balance this if

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.670
we cut it out?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.400
If we tried to balance it on
our fingers, where is the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.120
average mass concentrated?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.220
We want to find the moment of
inertia about the origin, and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.020
we want to find the moment of
inertia about the x-axis.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.870
So we're going to have to
remember our formulas for

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.060
moments of inertia.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870
So why don't you pause the video
and work on this for a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.660
little bit.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.950
Check back with me and I'll
show you how I solved it.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.210
Hi.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.180
Welcome back.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.620
Why don't we start by
finding the mass.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.570
So the mass is the most
straightforward of these, and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.020
I find it helpful to use the
language of differentials.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.750
So what I want us to do is I
want us to take a little

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.960
square here, and this little
square has area dA.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.830
OK?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.690
And what we want to do is we
want to sum up the masses of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.400
all the little squares
dA here.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.650
So what we want to know is what
is the little bit of mass

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.500
dM which corresponds to this
little bit of area dA.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
And more or less by definition,
this is delta dA.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
So delta is the ratio
of area to mass.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.410
And so this little contribution
of mass is just

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.200
delta times the little
contribution of area.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.950
OK?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.790
Now, once we write it this way,
then our total mass for

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.740
the entire square is just the
integral over the region of

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.820
all the little contributions
of dM.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.390
And so in particular, this is
just the integral from x

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.330
equals 0 to 1, y
equals 0 to 1.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.270
We have xy--

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.500
that's our density--

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.110
and then we have dy dx.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.690
OK.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.485
And this is an integral which
we can just compute.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.493
So why don't we compute this
one all the way through and

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:27.743
see what we get.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.600
OK.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.910
So we have integral
x equals 0 to 1.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.820
So we have xy, and we need
to integrate that in y.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.380
So we have xy squared over 2.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.350
And then y ranges
from 1 to 0, dx.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:04.940
So this is the integral from x
equals 0 to 1 of x over 2, dx.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.390
And this is just x squared
over 4 from 1 to 0.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.300
This is just 1/4.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.190
So that tells us that the
total mass of this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.140
unit square is 1/4.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.950
OK.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.770
So now, we need to do similar,
we have a similar challenge

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.620
for the other physical
quantities.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.360
We just need to figure out
what is the appropriate

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.110
differential quantity,
and then we just need

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.360
to integrate that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.420
For b, we need to compute
the center of mass.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.170
So remember that the center of
mass involves finding the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.580
average x-coordinate and the
average y-coordinate.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.670
And I wanted to remind you what
the formula is for the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.900
center of mass, and remind you
how I remind myself of it.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.610
So in the formula for the center
of mass, we need to

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:33.680
take the average of x times dM
divided by the integral of dM.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.900
So this is our formula for
the center of mass.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.760
And I just wanted to say that
the way that I remember this

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.160
is by thinking about seesaws.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.250
So if you think about it-- and
if we were not doing multiple

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.490
variables but a single
variable--

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.915
if I had a seesaw, and
I had some weights.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.830
So I had m1 and m2
and m3 and m4--

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.360
I had some weights--

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.900
and these were at positions
x1 and x2 and x3 and x4.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.630
Well, the fact that the scale
would be balanced would be to

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.390
say that this point x here,
where the fulcrum is located,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.840
is exactly the weighted average
of these points.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.980
That's what's going to guarantee
that there's the

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.590
same amount of torque pushing
this way and this way.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.940
So if we were in one variable
and we just had some discrete

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.680
weights, then we would want to
take the average of all of

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.700
these positions, and
we would want to

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.940
weight it with the masses.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:06.040
So we would want to take the
sum of xi mi and divide

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.720
by the sum of mi.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.020
This would be the average
coordinates in this kind of

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.420
toy example.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.390
And now if you look at the
formula for the center of

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.470
mass, it's really the same
thing, isn't it?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.350
Because integrals are just a
continuous version of the sum.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.730
We have x as a function
instead of xi--

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.790
as a list. And the mi's
are just the little

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.110
infinitesimal dM's here.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.070
And then the bottom here is
just the total mass of the

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.600
system, and so is this.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.520
OK, so that's how I
think about this

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.820
center of mass formula.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.790
And it's actually pretty
easy to compute.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.570
So we have the integral
from x equals 0 to 1,

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.060
y equals 0 to 1.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.830
So now we have x times
delta times dx dy.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:05.260
So altogether we get
x squared y dy dx.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.050
So one of those x's is because
we're averaging x and the

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.980
other one is from the
density function.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.150
So we have this whole
integral.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.360
And then we divide by this
integral of the mass, but we

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.110
already computed this in part a,
and we found it to be 1/4.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.580
OK.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.600
So this numerator
here is fairly

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.050
straightforward to compute.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.850
And if you do this
you'll get--

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.610
let me double check--

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.860
I believe we got 1/6.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.990
So you should get 1/6 when you
compute this integral.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:47.240
So we have 1/6 over 1/4,
and so cancelling

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.570
off, this is 2/3.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.600
OK.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.080
So that was just the
x center of mass.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.870
But now I want to make an
important point, which is that

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.040
this density function is
symmetric in x and y.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.320
It was just x times y.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.000
It wasn't something
more complicated.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.080
And so the center of mass in the
x-direction is just equal

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.740
to the center of mass in the
y-direction, so these are both

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.850
equal to 2/3.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.250
OK.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.210
So that depended on the fact
that our density was

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.560
symmetric, and also on the
fact that our region was

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.490
symmetric about switching
x and y.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.620
So we could save ourselves
some trouble here.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.520
OK, very good.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:38.350
So now to do c, again we need
to recall what is the

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.330
infinitesimal moment
of inertia.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.950
So let me draw this
picture again.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.720
So here's our little dA here.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.360
And we want to know the
infinitesimal moment of

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.850
inertia around the origin.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.260
So we tie a string to this
little piece of mass, and we

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.000
start spinning it, and we want
to know what is our moment of

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.250
inertia corresponding
to that little mass.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.460
And I'll just remind you from
lecture that the formula is r

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.340
squared dM.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.470
So this is r squared
times xy dx dy.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.180
And so the r squared here is
saying that as you get farther

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.090
and farther out, your moment of
inertia is getting larger

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.500
and larger.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.230
And this makes sense in terms
of the physical idea that

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.050
you're moving a longer
distance if

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.870
you're farther out.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.280
So anyway.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.590
So this is our formula
r squared dM.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:59.290
And so that tells us that I is
just the integral of dI.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:04.060
And so this is the integral
from x goes from 0 to 1, y

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.610
goes from 0 to 1.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.950
And then we have x squared
plus y squared--

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.560
that's just r squared--

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.380
times xy dx dy.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:41.280
And so we can rewrite this as x
cubed y plus xy cubed dx dy.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.840
And this is a computation
that we can do.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.490
Let me just check my
notes real quick.

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:55.680
So this is 1/4.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.715
I'll skip the computation, but
this is just integrating some

00:11:58.715 --> 00:11:59.965
polynomials, so we
can do that.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.770
All right.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.935
And now finally, we want to
compute the moment of inertia.

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:14.240
So remember, d asked us to
compute the moment of inertia

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.510
around the x-axis.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.770
So instead of around
the origin,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.510
it's around the x-axis.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.165
So the idea here is the same.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:33.210
So again, dI is a
factor times dM.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.270
And again, it's the radius, but
now it's the radius about

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.000
which we're spinning.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.570
So we're not anymore spinning
around the origin as we were

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.550
doing before.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.220
Now we're spinning around--

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.620
sort of out of the board--
around the x-axis here.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:58.760
But we still have the same
formula, and now our radius is

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.180
the height y.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.700
Because we're not spinning
around the origin anymore,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.690
we're spinning around
this rod here.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.640
And so if you think about it,
that's the radius about which

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.110
we're spinning is just
the height y.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:20.160
So this is just y
squared delta.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.150
OK.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:30.590
And so that tells us
that I --the total

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.950
inertia about the x-axis--

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.150
is just the integral of dI.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.980
And so we get the integral from
x equals 0 to 1, integral

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.200
y equals 0 to 1.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:54.510
And then we just have
y squared xy dy dx.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.290
And this, again, we could
compute-- and let me just

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.540
check my notes--

00:14:06.525 --> 00:14:07.860
and find that it's 1/8.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.720
So in each of these problems,
the most important thing to

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.930
have been able to do is to
argue, what is this sort of

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.660
infinitesimal contribution to
the physical quantity that you

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.220
want to compute?

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.400
And eventually, you want to
express it in terms of the

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.470
quantity dA, because
dA is what we

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.720
actually can integrate.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.500
And so all the other physical
quantities that we need to

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.560
study are going to be an
integral of some infinitesimal

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.870
element, and that infinitesimal
element is going

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.590
to be some coefficient
times dA.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.840
So here, we had that
this was--

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.960
oh, dear.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.370
This is a mistake.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:05.230
So this should have said y
squared dM, and that's y

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.980
squared delta dA.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.730
So I wrote the delta
implicitly.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.730
I wrote it twice.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.550
So what we meant to say is
dI is y squared delta dA.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.720
And so in all these examples,
the infinitesimal quantity

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.220
that we're after is some
straightforward coefficient

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.500
times the infinitesimal area.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.700
And so once we know that,
then we can just do a

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.500
straightforward integral.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.430
OK, and I'll leave it at that.
