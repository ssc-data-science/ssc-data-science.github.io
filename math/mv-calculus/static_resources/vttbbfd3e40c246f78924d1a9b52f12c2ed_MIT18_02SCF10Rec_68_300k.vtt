00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.600
Hi.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.110
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.980
In lecture you've been
learning about vector

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.330
calculus, Stokes' theorem,
all sorts of cool

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.570
stuff like that, curl.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.920
So I have a nice problem
here for you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.980
So let F be the following
vector field.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.440
So it's the vector field whose
direction is xi hat plus yj

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.090
hat plus zk hat, but in addition
I want to multiply it

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.030
by rho to the n.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.760
So this is your usual rho from
spherical coordinates.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.720
This is the square root
of x squared plus y

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.610
squared plus z squared.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130
And n can be any number.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.990
So it might be positive, it
might be negative, it might be

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.940
0, doesn't have to
be an integer.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.040
Some number, though,
it's some constant.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.320
So what I'd like you to do is
to show that for this field,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.090
regardless of what the value of
n happens to be, that it is

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.220
a gradient field.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.370
So it is the gradient
of some function.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at that, come

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.830
back and we can work
on it together.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.090
So recall that for something to
be a gradient field, what

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.850
that means--

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.430
well, first of all, that means
that there is some function

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.740
that has it as the gradient,
and we know a lot of other

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.010
characterizations of it.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.610
And one of them that we know
involves the curls.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520
So let's talk about that one.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.645
So in order to look at the curl
of this field, I'm going

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.300
to want to take partial
derivatives of its components.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.590
And so I'm going to want
to take partial

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.910
derivatives of rho.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.430
So let's just remember or
recall that partial rho

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.230
partial x equals z over rho.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.760
And similarly, partial rho
partial y is y over rho.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.200
And partial z partial--

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.720
sorry, partial rho partial
z is z over rho.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.930
So you can just check that using
the fact that you know

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050
what rho is.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.720
Et cetera.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.430
I'm going to write et cetera
because it's the same

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.680
for the other two.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.070
So let's call-- for
shorthand--

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:20.380
let's call F, Mi plus
Nj plus P times k.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.720
So M, N, and P are
its components.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:33.000
If F is this, then we know
that curl F is equal to--

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.580
what is it?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.970
So it's P, the y partial
derivative of P, minus the z

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.340
partial derivative of
N, i hat, plus--

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.590
OK, so it's the z partial
derivative of M minus the x

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.360
partial derivative of
P, j hat, plus--

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.380
it's going to be, what's
the last one?--

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.200
the x partial derivative of N,
minus the y partial derivative

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.480
of M k hat.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.650
So if this is our formula for
F, then this is our formula

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.780
for the curl of F. And OK, so
now we just have to compute

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.180
these various different partial
derivatives in order

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.720
to see what the curl is.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.900
And then hopefully
that'll tell us

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.630
something about this field.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.200
So let's see.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040
So Py.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.540
In our case, so M is equal to
rho to the little n times x.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.000
Big N is equal to rho to
the little n times y.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.140
And big P is equal to rho
to the little n times z.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.030
So let's look at our
components here.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.040
So P sub y--

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.590
well, z is a constant
with respect to y.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.340
So this is just rho to the n.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.990
Well, z times the y partial
of rho to the n.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.340
So that's by the chain rule, so
we got n rho to the n minus

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.110
1 times y over rho times z.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:34.450
So we can rewrite this as nyz
rho to the n minus 2.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:42.760
And similarly, so that
was P sub y, so let's

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.730
look at N sub z.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.000
So N is rho to the n times y.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.680
So you take the z partial

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.780
derivative, so y is a constant.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.700
So we need to look
at the z partial

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.960
derivative of P to the n.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.240
So this is, again, it's n--

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.130
sorry, I think I said
P to the n.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.360
But of course this isn't
a P, this is a rho.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.600
So it's n rho to the n minus 1
times partial rho partial z.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.610
So that's z over rho times y.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.490
And again, this is equal to
nyz rho to the n minus 2.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.960
OK, so P sub y, the y partial
of P is nyz rho

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.160
to the n minus 2.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.930
And the z partial of n is nyz
rho to the n minus 2.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.600
And they're the same.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.380
So what does that mean?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.890
So that means the first
component of curl of F is 0.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.730
So if you do a little bit more
arithmetic of exactly the same

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.780
sort, you have two more
components to check.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.980
What you're going to
find is that the

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.550
other ones are 0 also.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.250
I'm not going to do out all
those partial derivatives for

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.340
you, but I trust that you can
compute the similar looking

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.490
partial derivatives that appear
in these other two

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.610
components--

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.940
this j should have had a hat--

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.000
the other partial derivatives
that appear in these

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.260
components and show that they're
all also equal to 0.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:29.360
So in our case, curl of F is
just equal to 0 vector.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.670
OK, great.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.840
So what does that mean?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.000
Well, we want to show that
something is a gradient field.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.580
So we know that we
can do that.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.185
We know that that happens
precisely when its curl is 0

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:50.790
if it's defined on a simply
connected domain.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.280
On a simply connected region.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.950
So we know that a function is
a gradient field if it's

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.320
defined on a simply connected
domain and has curl 0.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.720
Well, let's see.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.700
So where is this
thing defined?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.130
Where is F defined?

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.850
Well, if n is bigger than
or equal to 0--

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.470
well, I guess I want strictly
bigger than 0 just to be on

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.400
the safe side.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.180
If n is positive,
this is defined

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.300
everywhere and we're great.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.230
If n is negative, then we
have a problem at 0.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.420
Because then we have
division by rho.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.560
So we don't want
to divide by 0.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.560
So if n is negative, there's
a problem at the origin.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.730
So in the worst case,
F is defined

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.100
everywhere except the origin.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.320
But that's simply connected.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.340
Because we're in space.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.530
If we were in the plane, this
would be a different story.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.610
But in space, just removing a
point doesn't destroy simply

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.860
connectedness.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.470
So this field F is defined
everywhere, except the origin

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.700
perhaps, so we're in a simply
connected region.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.370
So when you have curl F in a
simply connected region, your

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.520
field is, in fact,
a gradient field.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.150
Now I leave it as an exercise
to you to come up with the

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.920
actual function, or one of the
actual functions, of which

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.830
this is a gradient.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.340
But we've just shown that
because its curl is 0, and

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.510
because it's defined in a simply
connected region of

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.410
space, that this field really
is the gradient

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.760
field of some function.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.630
So I'll stop there.
