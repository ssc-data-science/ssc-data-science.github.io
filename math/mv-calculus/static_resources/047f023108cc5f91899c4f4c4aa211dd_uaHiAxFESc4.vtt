DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.500
Today what we want to work
on is drawing level curves.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.520
This is for all the artists
out there in the audience.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.980
We have three functions
here: z is 2x plus y,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.610
z is x squared plus
y squared, and z

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.782
is x squared minus
y squared, and we

00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:26.990
want to get some practice
drawing their level curves.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.150
Now, just to remind
you, the level curves

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.730
are not drawn in
three dimensions.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.530
They're drawn in the
xy-plane and they're

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.590
constructed by setting
z to be a constant

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.490
and then graphing the
curve that we get,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.250
so we can think
about a relief map

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.440
that we might use
if we were hiking.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.030
So why don't you
get started on that.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.820
Pause the video, and
we'll check back,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.770
and I'll show you
how I solve this.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.440
Welcome back.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.850
So over here, we've
got the equation

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.330
for part a already set up.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.070
So z is 2x plus y.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.630
So now, what we need
to do to get started

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.140
is just draw the xy-axis.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.870
And, you know, there's
really not a precise science

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.780
for drawing these
level curves out.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.510
We just need to choose
some values of z

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.830
that we feel are representative
and then just draw them in.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.910
So one thing we
notice about this

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.460
is that if we choose
z to be a constant,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.210
then the equations
that we're going to get

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.150
is 2x plus y equals
some constant, right?

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.110
So, you know, these are
just going to be lines.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.600
The level curves in this case
are just going to be lines.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.360
So, for instance, if we take
the level curve at z equals 0,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.730
then we have just the
equation 2x plus y equals 0.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.190
And so that has intercept--
so we're looking at-- so 0

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.090
equals 2x plus y, so that's
just y equals minus 2x.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.150
So that's this level curve.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.789
That's the level
curve at z equals 0.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.080
Now, if you think about it,
all the other level curves,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.129
we're just going to be
varying the constant here,

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.170
and so we're just going
to be shifting this line.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.000
So all of our level
curves in this case

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.520
are just straight lines.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.011
So let's see if we can
make some sense out of that

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.510
by thinking about
the graph in three

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.170
dimensions of this function.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.415
So over here, I'm going
to draw-- So this function

00:02:56.415 --> 00:03:00.500
z equals 2x plus y,
if we draw its graph,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.270
it's just a plane, right?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.080
So it's just a plane, which I'll
just kind of draw in cartoon

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.870
form, something like that.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.080
And now when we do level
curves, what we're doing

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.670
is we're slicing this plane
with another plane, which

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.480
is the horizontal values
where z is a constant.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.590
And so, for instance, if we
take the level curve here,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.080
then we're just intersecting
these two planes,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.090
and their intersection
is just a line,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.310
and that's exactly the lines
that we're drawing here.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.590
So it's not surprising that we
were graphing a linear function

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.780
and that our contour
lines, our level curves,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.790
were just straight lines.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.730
So let's go on to a slightly
more interesting example, which

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.210
is part b, which I
have written up here.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.030
So this is the function z
equals x squared plus y squared.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.160
Actually, this is even
easier to get started

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.670
drawing the level curves for.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.350
Well, if you think about
it, if I fix the value of z,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.810
then this is
exactly the equation

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.880
for the circle with
radius square root of z.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:28.950
So level curves, level
curves for the function z

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.340
equals x squared plus y
squared, these are just

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.890
circles in the xy-plane.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.020
And if we're being careful
and if we take the convention

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.830
that our level curves are
evenly spaced in the z-plane,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.690
then these are going to get
closer and closer together,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.830
and we'll see in a minute
where that's coming from.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.885
So let's draw what's going
on in three dimensions.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.240
So if we graph z
equals x squared

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.320
plus y squared in
three dimensions,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.420
this is just a
paraboloid opening up.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.380
And now what you can
see is that if we

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.540
slice this through the
constant-- through z

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.730
equals constant
planes, then we're

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.090
just getting these circles,
and those are precisely

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.520
the circles that we're
drawing on the level curve.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.240
And because the parabola
gets steeper and steeper,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.900
that's telling us
that these circles,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.460
if we keep incrementing z in a
constant way, that's telling us

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.850
that the circles, which
are the shadows below here,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.580
are going to get closer
and closer and closer.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.050
This reflects the fact that this
is getting steeper and steeper.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.640
In fact, this is generally true.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.310
If you're looking
at a contour plot

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.710
where the intervals
between level curves

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.510
are at regular distances,
then very close contour lines

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.850
means that the function
is very steep there.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.290
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.480
Let's look at one more example.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.210
This is z equals x
squared minus y squared.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:31.110
So to get started with
this, well, again,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.020
if we start choosing
constant values of z,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.480
this is just giving
us hyperbola,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.340
hyperbolas of two sheets.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.910
So, for instance, if
we take-- so let's

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.230
see what happens if
we take z equals 0.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.870
So if we take z equals 0, then
something a little special

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.040
happens.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.210
This becomes x plus y
times x minus y equals 0.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.710
We can factorize x
squared minus y squared

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.060
as x plus y times x minus
y, and if this is 0,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.190
then that means either plus
y is 0 or x minus y is 0.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:13.650
So that tells is that the zero
level curves for this graph

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.565
are the lines y equals minus
x and the lines y equals x.

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:21.070
OK.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:27.220
And now, if we move z away from
that, then what we're getting

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:45.170
are hyperbolas, and these
hyperbolas will approach

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.360
this asymptotic line y equals
minus x or this line-- sorry,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.627
this line y equals x or this
line equals y equals minus x.

00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:55.210
They'll approach
this as they go down,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.190
but they'll never
quite reach it.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.600
So the level curves here
are just hyperbolas.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.690
So now let's see, what
is this telling us

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.255
about the three-dimensional
graph of this function?

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.800
OK, so, first of all, we
have these level curves

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.580
when y equals x and
when y equals minus

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.220
x, and so those level
curves we can kind of draw.

00:08:30.004 --> 00:08:32.420
OK, so I want you to think
that that sits in the xy-plane.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.810
It's kind of hard to
draw in three dimensions.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.610
And so this is where our
function is going to be zero.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:49.470
Now, if we take x to
be positive-- sorry.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:58.030
If we take x to be greater
than y and both positive,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.410
then this is a positive number
and this is a positive number.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.520
So if we look in
the region where

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.090
x and y are both
positive, that's in here,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.790
and where x is greater than
y, then our function comes up.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.260
So it looks like
this, and then it

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:23.220
dips down and goes down, comes
back up, and goes back down.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.660
And now at the middle here,
it has to dip down to zero,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.710
so we have something like this.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:34.790
So what we end up getting in
the end, this is a saddle,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.160
so it's a bit hard to draw.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.000
It's a bit hard to see on this
so let me draw a sketch of it

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.600
off of the axes for you.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.050
So we have a rise,
and then a drop,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.940
and then a rise in the back,
and then a drop, and then

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.190
down the middle it dips
down in this direction

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.880
and it rises up
in this direction,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.630
so it's a saddle like you
could put this on a horse

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.130
and ride it.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.610
And so we can see that the
three-dimensional contours

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:14.000
of the saddle, when we
look at their projection

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.340
down onto the contour plot,
become these hyperbolas.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.200
So a saddle is sort
of like a hyperbola

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.790
stretched out into
three dimensions.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.926
And I think I'll
leave it at that.
