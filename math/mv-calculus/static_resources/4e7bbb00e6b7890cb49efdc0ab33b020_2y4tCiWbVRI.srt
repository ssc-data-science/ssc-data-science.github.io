JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,650
My name is Joel Lewis.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,080
At the time of this
recording in 2010

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm a graduate student in
the Math Department at MIT,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,594
and I'm also a TA for OCW
Scholar 18.01 and 18.02.

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:18,510
CHRISTINE BREINER: Hi.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm Christine Breiner.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm a Moore Instructor here
at MIT and for OCW Scholar,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,535
I'll be a teaching assistant
for 18.01 and for 18.02.

10
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:29,170
DAVID JORDAN: My
name is David Jordan

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,400
and I'm a graduate
student here at MIT.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,910
And I'm a TA for
OpenCourseWare Scholar 18.02.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,020
So I thought I would say a
little bit about what we do

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,814
with recitations here at MIT.

15
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:44,230
So, the purpose
of the recitations

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,840
is for you to apply
what you've learned

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,680
in lecture towards solving
specific concrete problems

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,540
and then for you to compare
your solutions to those problems

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,699
with those of your TA.

20
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,740
CHRISTINE BREINER: The
purpose of the recitations

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,660
on OCW Scholar is
really the same purpose

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,526
that David described for
recitations here at MIT.

23
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,400
What we want you to do
is have an opportunity

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,410
to work varying
levels of problems

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,330
and then see us give detailed
solutions to those problems

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,725
so that you can see how we
think about mathematics.

27
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,560
JOEL LEWIS: Almost
all of our videos

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,450
have a natural
moment where you can

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,530
pause after the
problem's been stated.

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,330
And we really strongly
suggest you work out

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,510
the problem on a piece of paper
before going back to the video

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,020
and seeing our solutions.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,850
This will help
you do mathematics

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,850
rather than be able
just to see mathematics.

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,820
Hope you enjoy the course.
