DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.630
So the problem I'd like
to work with you

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.090
today is this one here.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.230
It's just to compute this
two-variable integral, and the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.440
integrand that we're going
to be computing is e

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.390
to the u over u.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.890
And what you might notice right
away is that this inner

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.090
integral, it's an integral over
u of e to the u over u,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.520
and this is not an integral that
we have a nice formula

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.790
for from one-variable
calculus.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.690
So I'm going to suggest that, as
you try to solve this, you

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.670
think about how can you use
the fact that this is a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.942
multivariable integral, maybe
swapping the order of

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:42.390
integration, et cetera,
to solve this.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.540
So why don't you go ahead and
work this problem on your own.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.160
Check back with me in a
few minutes, and I'll

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.410
see how I did it.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.030
OK, welcome back.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.570
So as I suggested, I think what
we should do is we should

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.840
see what happens if we switch
the order of integration.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.680
I don't know how to do this
inside integral, and so maybe

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.460
if we switch the order of
integration, then something's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.740
going to work out.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.800
So in order to get started doing
that, we need to draw

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.360
the region of integration,
so why don't we

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.370
do that over here.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.030
So I'll just walk over here.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.280
So we've got--

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.400
our variables are t and
u, so I've drawn the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.190
t- and u-axes here.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.060
And now, let's look at the
region of integration.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.630
So t is running from 0 to 1/4.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.730
So we'll just draw
1/4 about there.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.110
And now the range for u, the
bottom range is the square

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.530
root of t, so I'm going to
draw the curve u is the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.255
square root of t.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:55.710
It just looks like a parabola
on its side.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.050
And then the top bound
is at u equals 1/2.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.320
And notice that when t is 1/4,
that means that u is 1/2,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.490
because u is just the
square root of t.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.030
And so what we're really
interested in is this region

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
here, the region between u is
the square root of t and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
between u is 1/2, so
this is our region.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.830
So let's rewrite the integral
by swapping the order of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.670
integration, so I'll
do that here.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.580
So now on the outside, we want
to put the range of u first.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.890
So the range of u, we can see
on the graph here, u ranges

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.180
from 0 to 1/2, so that's
going to be easy.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.190
And now t, so t is always
starting right here at t

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.350
equals 0, and it's always ending
at this curve, which is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.350
t equals u squared.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.570
So we have these little
integrals here.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.160
And so our ranges for t is going
to be t is running from

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.580
0 to u squared.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.920
Then we have the same integrand
e to the u over u,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.370
and now we have dt du.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.070
All right.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.170
Now we see that this was a
nice thing to do, because

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.030
look: The first integral that we
need to take is an integral

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.640
in t, but our integrand doesn't
involve the variable

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.910
t, so this is going to be a very
easy integral to take.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.720
So I just take that integrand
and I just multiply it by the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.740
constant t, so we just have e
to the u over u times t, and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.750
then it's a definite integral
which ranges from u

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.160
squared to 0 du.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.990
And so this is just
going to be--

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.620
1/2 here--

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.820
this is really just going to be
ue to the u du, all right?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.200
So let me write that
up over here again.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.910
So we're at integral from
u equals 0 to 1/2

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.650
of ue to the u du.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.830
And now we want to remember the
method of integration by

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.223
parts from one-variable
calculus.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.990
So integration by parts, you'll
remember, will tell us

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:04.530
that the integral of ue to the
u is going to be ue to the u

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.010
minus e to the u.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.480
So that's just applying
integration by parts.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.610
And then this is a definite
integral, so we have a

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.350
range 1/2 to 0.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.090
Well, now, we can just plug this
in, so we get 1/2e to the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:33.070
1/2 minus e to the 1/2 minus the
quantity, so we just get 0

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.680
minus e to the 0.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.750
And so altogether, we have--

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.410
let's see, we have a negative
e to the 1/2 and then

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.790
we have a plus 1.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.660
And negative e to the 1/2 over
2, because we had 1/2 and a

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.700
minus a whole, and
then plus 1.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.540
And that's our solution.
