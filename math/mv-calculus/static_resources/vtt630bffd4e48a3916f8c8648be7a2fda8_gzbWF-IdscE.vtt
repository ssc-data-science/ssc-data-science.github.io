DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.360
In this question,
we're going to be

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.610
considering a
contour plot, which

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.230
is given to us as followed.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.010
The values are not indicated.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.830
So the first thing
that we want to do

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.450
is we want to identify--
on this contour plot,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.850
there is a unique
saddle point, and we

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.780
want to label that
as point A, and there

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.250
are two points which are
either a maximum or a minimum.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.980
We can't actually tell
because the labels aren't

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.030
on this contour
plot, but we want

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.140
to go ahead and label
those anyways: B and C.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.599
So they're either
maxima or minima,

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.015
but we can still find them and
we can still identify them.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.690
So that's the first
part of the problem.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.410
The second part is, since this
doesn't have the values entered

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.240
onto the graph, we
want to consider

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.400
what possible configurations
could we have?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:07.830
So the second question is:
can B and C both be maximal?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:22.720
And can we have B
maximal but C minimal?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.220
OK.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.830
And then in each
of these two cases,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.495
we want to sketch the 3D graph.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.720
So why don't you take some
time to work this out.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.612
Pause the video, and
we'll check back,

00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:49.070
and I'll show you
how I solve this.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.455
Hello, and welcome back.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:00.830
So to get started, why don't
we answer the first question

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.630
by writing the points right
on our original graph.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.830
So I'll just come over here.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
Now, when we're looking
for a minimum or a maximum

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.550
on a contour plot,
you know, the thing

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.500
that we should keep in mind
is that a minimal or a maximal

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
always is going to be contained
in concentric contours that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.340
are either approaching
the minimum from below

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.880
or-- excuse me-- approaching
the maximum from below

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.450
or the minimum from above.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.410
And so if we look here, we
see that these rings start

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.090
to become concentric,
and somewhere in here,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.700
there's got to be either
a maximum or a minimum.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.880
Because, you know, inside
this little region here,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.150
the function doesn't pass
through another contour plot,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.410
so we have to find either
a maximum or a minimum

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.460
inside the innermost ring.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.751
And similarly, we have to find
either a minimum or a maximum

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:00.250
here.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.850
So let's just call this
one B and this one C. OK.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.900
Now, we also have a saddle
point A in this problem,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.550
and it's a little bit hard
to see in the contour plot.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.450
I think it'll be a little
even clearer when we draw a 3D

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.720
graph, but basically
what's happening

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.540
is the fact that you
have these contours--

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.830
so this contour is, after
all, the same as that contour.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.680
So the value of the function
here and here are the same,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.240
and yet, if we
look at this point

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.220
and this point, the values,
they'll either go up or down.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.890
We don't know.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.690
Let's assume that they go up.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.730
So here, in this direction,
the values are going up,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.050
and in this
direction, the values

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.670
are determined by
this contour curve,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.560
and so somewhere in
this middle region here,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.935
there's got to be
a saddle point.

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:59.440
I think this'll be even
clearer when we draw our graph.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.370
So we have a saddle point
A in the middle there.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.150
And, in fact, this
is really-- this

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.180
is the general picture
of what a saddle point is

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.110
going to look like.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.800
It's going to be when you have
two either maxima or minima

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.190
rising out, and
you have a contour

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.500
which is containing the
point in the middle.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.760
So those are our
points A, B and C

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.340
that we're going to
be interested in.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.430
So now, the second question
that we have to consider

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.200
is can B and C both be maximal?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.887
And the third question is can
B be maximal and C minimal?

00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:39.970
And actually, we'll answer
both of these questions

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.650
by just sketching an
example, so that's how will

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.800
we'll understand this.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.740
So why don't we see if we
can sketch an example where

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.145
B and C are both maximal.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.690
So here's the start of my
graph in three dimensions,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.300
and if we want B and C
to both be maximal, then

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.710
let me go ahead and draw the
contour lines that we have.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.000
So we have, first of
all, we had this one,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.660
and then we had another
one, and then we had a peak,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.610
and then we had a peak.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.036
So if we want to draw
this in three dimensions,

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.660
then what we just
need to do is we just

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.360
need to follow these contour
plots up out of the plane

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.550
and into space.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.350
So this goes up, and
then there's a maximum,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.490
and then it comes back down
along the contour lines,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.170
and then it goes back up,
and then it goes back down.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.600
So that's just one
of the curves that

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.160
lies on the graph
of the function,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.720
but then we need to flesh
out the contour lines, which,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.420
they look like these
sort of rings here.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.920
OK?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.194
And so, indeed, we do see that
it's possible for both B and C

00:06:05.194 --> 00:06:05.860
to be a maximal.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220
Here's an example
of such a thing.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.920
And so here's our point
B, here's our point C,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.190
and as promised, I think
it's much clearer now

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.510
how A becomes a saddle point.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.050
Because you have these
two mountains rising up,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.200
and the valley in between
them is necessarily

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.220
a little saddle here.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.790
It increases in this
direction and it

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.290
decreases in this direction.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.550
Now, for the second
one, we're asked

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.750
can B be maximal and
yet C be minimal?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.950
And the answer is still yes.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.120
And a nice way to think
about this problem,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.150
to think about the graph
that I'm going to draw,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.240
is imagine that we start
over here and we dig a hole,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.660
and as we're digging, we
throw the dirt over behind us.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.920
So we're going to have
a hole, a dip here,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.678
and then we're going to
pile that hole up over here.

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:04.022
And so then--

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.280
Now, notice that both of
these that I've drawn,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.900
if we don't label
the contour lines,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.080
these have the
same contour plot,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.280
because the
concentric rings on C,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.540
which are telling us that
the function in increasing,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.110
they're the same below,
because this is essentially

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.610
the same thing.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.100
The concentric rings that on
this curve, on this surface,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.530
were telling us that B
was a maximal point, now

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.370
the same rings are telling
us that B is a minimal point.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.730
So this illustrates that
a contour plot is really--

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.890
doesn't tell you
everything about the graph

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.950
unless you actually label
the values of the contours.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.660
So here we see
two examples where

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.396
the sort of global
behavior of B and C

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:07.770
are very different even though
they have the same contour

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.380
plot.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.580
Now notice, in both cases,
A is a saddle point.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:20.710
It's increasing in one direction
and decreasing in the other.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.469
And I think I'll
leave it at that.
