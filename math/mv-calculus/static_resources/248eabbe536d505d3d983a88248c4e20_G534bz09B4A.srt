CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,570
In this video, we want to
work on using the change

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,030
of variables technique.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,620
In particular, we're going to
look at the following problem.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,880
It says, using the change
of variables u is equal to x

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,020
squared minus y squared and
v is equal to y divided by x,

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,970
supply the limits and integrand
for the following integral,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,490
which is the double integral
over region R of 1 over x

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,380
squared, dx*dy.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,530
And R is the infinite region
in the first quadrant that

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,500
is both under the
curve y equals 1

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
over x, and to the
right of the curve

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,410
x squared minus y
squared equals 1.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,360
So this is a
challenging problem.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,030
Again, I want to
point out we just

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,780
want to find the limits
and the integrand.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,820
You don't actually have
to compute the integral.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,440
But it is going to be
tough, but stick with it.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,870
Pause the video, give it
your best shot-- hopefully

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,900
you find the appropriate
limits and integrand--

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,499
and then when you
feel comfortable,

22
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,790
bring the video back up, and
I'll show you how I do it.

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,760
OK.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,565
Welcome back.

25
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:15,940
So once again,
what we want to do

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,900
is this change of
variables problem

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,750
where we've defined u to be
x squared minus y squared,

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,840
v to be y divided by x, and
we have this region that

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
is in the first
quadrant and it's

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,940
under the curve y
equals 1 divided by x

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,440
and it's to the right of the
curve x squared minus y squared

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,876
equals 1.

33
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,250
And we want to
compute the limits

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,624
and integrand for that
particular integral.

35
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,290
So what I'm going to
do, to try and make

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,310
this as organized
as possible, is

37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm going to try first
to graph the region R,

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,214
or to figure out what the
region R is in the xy-plane.

39
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,380
Then I'm going to try and
figure out what the region

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,450
R is mapped to in the uv-plane.

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,270
So what it looks
like in the uv-plane.

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,300
That will give me my limits.

43
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,670
And then I'm going to try
and determine the Jacobian.

44
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,490
And then I will determine
from that and the fact

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,800
that I started with 1 divided by
x squared as my function I was

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,150
integrating, I will
put those two together

47
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,431
to figure out the integrand.

48
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,430
So there are a bunch of
steps to these problems.

49
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,140
But the first one, again is I'm
going to graph the region R.

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,000
So I'm going to give you a
very rough sketch, over here,

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,569
of the region R. And I know
it's in the first quadrant

52
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,610
and I know it's infinite.

53
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,380
I was already told that.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,880
OK.

55
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,200
So in the xy-plane, the region
R is below the curve y equals 1

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
over x.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,510
So let me draw that curve.

58
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,200
Again, this is very rough.

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,370
This is a rough sketch.

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm putting up no
scale on purpose.

61
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,770
I'll put in one value,
maybe, in this whole thing.

62
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,610
OK?

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,520
And so this is the curve
y equals one over x.

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,350
And then I need
the curve which is

65
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,400
part of the hyperbola that
is x squared minus y squared

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,280
equals 1.

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,520
So I'll draw in
the part we need,

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,790
which looks roughly like this.

69
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,490
Something like that.

70
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,890
Again, this is not meant
to be an exact graph,

71
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,940
but to give you an idea of
what the region looks like.

72
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,790
And the only thing
I'm going to mention

73
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,500
is that this point we know
is x equals 1 and y equals 0.

74
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,520
So the region we're
interested in that

75
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,980
is both to the right of x
squared minus y squared equals

76
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,130
1 and below y equals 1 over
x and in the first quadrant

77
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,970
is exactly this region
I'm shading here.

78
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,350
So we want to understand
what the values of u and v

79
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,500
are along these bounds.

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,650
We need to understand
where this region maps

81
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,820
to when I do the
change of variables

82
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,040
in order to understand
what the limits are.

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,770
So let me put the graph of
this region in the uv-plane

84
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,690
so that we can really
understand what our bounds are.

85
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,779
And I know already
where it's going.

86
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,070
So I'm going to just make
the first quadrant, because I

87
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,260
know this is going into
the first quadrant.

88
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,580
So it doesn't always
work that something

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,260
in the first quadrant maps
into the first quadrant,

90
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,860
but in this case, I already did
the work, so I know it does.

91
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,252
So let me point out a few things
about where this region R maps.

92
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,710
The first thing I
want to point out

93
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,800
is that we actually
know that this curve,

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,800
under the change of
variables, maps to u equals 1.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,130
Because if you remember, u
is equal to x squared minus y

96
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,120
squared.

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,740
So this whole curve is
going to map to u equals 1.

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Now, I don't want the
whole curve for my region.

99
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,640
I only want this
little piece of it.

100
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
So I'm going to
have-- in my uv plane,

101
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm going to have
some segment at 1.

102
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,810
And actually, I'll
just know that it's

103
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,980
some part of the line u equals
1 is going to show up in there.

104
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,660
But if you notice, I know
where it starts right away.

105
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,200
Because at x equal
1, y equals 0,

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,780
if I look at what v is-- if
we come back here and remember

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,790
what v is-- at x equal
1, y equals 0-- v is 0.

108
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,990
And so my starting point on this
segment-- if we come back here,

109
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,760
my starting point
on this segment

110
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,760
is actually also at (1, 0).

111
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,520
OK?

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,550
So I know there's
some point right

113
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,520
here that maps down to here
where the segment will stop.

114
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,180
I'll find that point
later, algebraically.

115
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,680
Right?

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,560
And then now we need to figure
out where these two curves go.

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,720
And then we can get
a picture, and then

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,220
we'll figure out
what that point is,

119
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,920
and we'll understand
all the limits.

120
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,800
So the first thing I want to
point out is along this curve,

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,469
we have y equals 0
and x is non-zero.

122
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,010
And just to help
ourselves, I'm going

123
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,200
to rewrite what the
change of variables

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,720
is here, so I don't have to keep
walking over to the other side.

125
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,770
Our change of variables
was u is equal to x

126
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,420
squared minus y squared, and
v was equal to y divided by x.

127
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,130
So this whole curve
has y equals 0.

128
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,490
So what happens to u and what
happens to v along that curve?

129
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,470
Well, u is going
to be x squared,

130
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,760
and v is going to equal 0.

131
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,710
And so the point
of this, really,

132
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,520
is that even though
in u, this curve maybe

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,890
is mapping at a different speed
in some form to this curve

134
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,030
here, it's still-- it's just
taking that segment goes--

135
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,240
or that infinitely long ray goes
to an infinitely long ray here

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,900
along the u-axis.

137
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,520
And again, that's because
along this ray, y equals 0.

138
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
And so v is equal
to 0 everywhere on

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,631
that ray and u is positive--
it's equal to x squared.

140
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,130
OK?

141
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,940
So I'm going to move
the u out of the way,

142
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,490
because we're going to say
this is part of the region,

143
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,880
or that's one bound
of the region.

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,490
And now I have to figure
out where this curve goes.

145
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,850
This curve is slightly
more complicated,

146
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,280
but I can still figure it out.

147
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,110
So I'm going to show you how I
do that sort of algebraically.

148
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,590
That curve-- if you
notice, if you remember--

149
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,580
is y equals 1 divided by x.

150
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,550
So that means that
on that curve--

151
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,740
let me even write it down--
on y equals 1 divided by x, v

152
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,710
is equal to 1 divided
by x divided by x.

153
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,470
So v is equal to 1 divided
by x squared, right?

154
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,500
And then what does
that mean about u?

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,620
u, then, is equal to-- well,
x squared is 1 divided by v,

156
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,140
and then y squared, because y
squared on that curve is just 1

157
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,130
divided by x squared,
is v. So let me just

158
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,100
make sure we all followed
that one more time.

159
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,260
We're looking at where
the curve y equals 1

160
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,890
over x goes in the change
of variables, right?

161
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,950
So that's the top curve up here.

162
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,572
y equals 1 over x is the
top curve of our region R.

163
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,030
So we want to know
where that goes.

164
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,120
Well, on y equals 1
over x, v is exactly

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,690
equal to 1 over x squared,
because v-- we know--

166
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,510
is y over x.

167
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,870
So if I just substitute in
for y, I get 1 over x squared.

168
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,360
Now, if I look at
this relationship,

169
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,345
this means x squared is equal
to 1 over v. So in terms of u,

170
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,400
x squared becomes 1
over v. And then y

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,120
squared-- which is
1 over x squared--

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,470
become v. So that curve is
u equals 1 over v minus v.

173
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,434
Now that curve,
roughly, is going

174
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,600
to look something like this.

175
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,950
And it might seem strange.

176
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,400
The thing is, I'm graphing
this in the uv-plane,

177
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,430
and I'm writing what looks
like u as a function of v,

178
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,870
and so it's sort of turned
around from how you usually

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,070
see these things written.

180
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,480
But this is the equation
that describes this curve.

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,300
And that is sufficient
to understand,

182
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,500
because when we use our--
when we determine our bounds,

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,190
we can determine our bounds from
u equals 0 now, to u equals 1

184
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,700
over v minus v. So we
now have the bounds in u.

185
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,630
We're actually doing quite well.

186
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,830
So we have this region.

187
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,430
We now have the bounds
completely in u.

188
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,100
u is going from u equals 0
to u equals 1 over v minus v.

189
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,090
But the problem is now
we don't know the bounds

190
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,690
in v. We don't know what
the bounds are in v,

191
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,590
and so we have to be
a little bit careful.

192
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,387
So actually, no.

193
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,220
I think I was wrong.

194
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,230
It's not 0, is it?

195
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,630
I said that twice now,
and that was incorrect.

196
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,220
u is going from 1, to 1 over
v minus v. So I apologize.

197
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,360
Because the slices of u
are going from whatever

198
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,480
the u-value starts--
which is at the value 1--

199
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,780
and it's coming this way.

200
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,720
So I apologize.

201
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,470
I was moving my arm like
I was doing the v-values,

202
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,040
but I actually wanted
to do the u-values.

203
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,340
So I want to go from where
u starts-- which is at u

204
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,030
equals 1-- to where u stops--
which is when it hits the curve

205
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,440
1 over v minus v equals u.

206
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,540
So hopefully I didn't
confuse anyone by that.

207
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm glad I caught it, then.

208
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,406
OK, so now we understand
the bounds in u.

209
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,780
And then to
understand the bounds

210
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,570
in v, all we need to
understand is what

211
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,850
is the v-value at this point.

212
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,940
So once I know the
v-value at this point,

213
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,010
then I'm done with the bounds.

214
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,220
So let's see if
we can find that.

215
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,500
Well, the v-value at that point
is going to be at the point

216
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,640
where these two
curves intersect.

217
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,019
So let's see if we can do a
little algebra to understand

218
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,060
what that will look like.

219
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,660
So let me point out that
where those curves intersect,

220
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,250
I have the equation x squared
minus 1 over x squared

221
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,130
is equal to 1.

222
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,980
And if I want to find
x-values that satisfy this,

223
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,836
I'm also looking for
x-values that satisfy

224
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:53,580
x to the fourth minus 1
is equal to x squared,

225
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,900
which I can rewrite as x to the
fourth minus x squared minus 1

226
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,790
is equal to 0.

227
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,010
So I can actually use
the quadratic formula

228
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,350
on this in terms of x squared.

229
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,890
So what I get is I get x
squared is equal to 1--

230
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,890
I get plus or minus
root 5-- over 2.

231
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,947
And if you look at it,
the one you're actually

232
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,280
interested in-- you can figure
this out pretty quickly--

233
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,340
is the one that is plus.

234
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,110
OK?

235
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,080
I want the one that
is plus root 5 over 2.

236
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,090
So then that means x is the
square root of this quantity

237
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,740
at that point, right?

238
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,600
Or I could actually
think about it this way.

239
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,300
Let me point out
this. v is equal to 1

240
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,330
over x squared at that
point, because it's

241
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,494
on that curve where we
were talking about y

242
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:45,160
equals 1 over x.

243
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,940
So v is 1 over x squared.

244
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,530
So 1 over x squared is
just 1 over this quantity.

245
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,950
So it's the reciprocal of this.

246
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,640
It's also negative 1
plus root 5, over 2.

247
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,460
You can check that
if you need to.

248
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,200
But I will write it down
this way as the following:

249
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,790
this is the point 1 comma a.

250
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:12,530
And if I come over here, I will
denote a will equal negative 1

251
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,480
plus root 5, over 2.

252
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,810
And that's really just
1 divided by x squared.

253
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,620
So let me point that
out again, that a

254
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,987
is equal to 1
divided by x squared

255
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:26,195
at the point of intersection.

256
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,540
So hopefully you
can see all that.

257
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,410
So that tells us our
bounds completely.

258
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,480
We still have some work to do.

259
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,020
So I'm going to
put in the bounds

260
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,259
and I'm going to
leave an empty space.

261
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:44,800
Actually, no.

262
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,652
I won't do that,
because this can get

263
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:47,860
a little messy and confusing.

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,402
So I'm just going
to do the Jacobian,

265
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,610
and then we'll figure it
all out and write the answer

266
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,760
right at the end, so
there's no confusion.

267
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,410
But hopefully you see at this
point that we have the bounds.

268
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,830
We know that u goes from
1, to 1 over v minus v.

269
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,910
And v goes from 0
up to a, where a

270
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,400
is the value I've written here.

271
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,210
So we know the bounds.

272
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,250
So now we have to figure
out the integrand.

273
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,350
So let's first compute
the Jacobian, OK?

274
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,940
So now we're looking
at del u, v del x, y,

275
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,410
using the notation
we've seen in class.

276
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,602
And so del u, v
del x, y is going

277
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:28,680
to be the determinant
of the following matrix:

278
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,690
2x, negative 2y.

279
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,130
And then the derivative
respect to v of x

280
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,340
is negative y over x squared.

281
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,810
And the derivative of v with
respect to y is just 1 over x.

282
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:49,850
So if I take the determinant
of that, I get 2 minus 2 y

283
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,600
squared over x squared.

284
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,275
Which if you notice, in terms
of our change of variables,

285
00:13:55,275 --> 00:14:04,370
is exactly equal to 2 minus 2 v
squared, because v is y over x.

286
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,340
And so I can rewrite
this as 2 times

287
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,010
the quantity 1 minus v squared.

288
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,190
OK?

289
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,910
So, so far so good, hopefully.

290
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,900
Now let's figure out how
to do the final step.

291
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,780
So the final step-- I'm
going to come back over

292
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,795
and just remind us what
the integrand was, OK?

293
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:28,230
If we come over here,
we're reminded that we were

294
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,050
integrating over the region
R of 1 over x squared, dx*dy.

295
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,550
Right?

296
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,760
That's what we were
interested in initially.

297
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,672
So now, if we come back, I'm
going to write that down just

298
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,755
to have it as a reference.

299
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,130
OK, that's what
we had initially.

300
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,220
Let me make sure.

301
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,950
Yes, that's what
we had initially.

302
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:03,030
And so now we know dx*dy is
equal to du*dv over 2 times 1

303
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,620
minus v squared.

304
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,730
So that is going to
replace the dx*dy.

305
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,470
And now we have to figure
out what to do with the 1

306
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,530
over x squared.

307
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,470
But, what do we have here?

308
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,660
Now I have to remind myself.

309
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,160
I can't remember all
the steps anymore.

310
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,710
We have u is equal to x
squared minus y squared.

311
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,470
Let me come back.

312
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,970
Now I've forgotten
what I was doing.

313
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,260
Ah, yes.

314
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,310
Now I remember, sorry.

315
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,980
OK.

316
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,960
So the point I should have
remembered that I forgot,

317
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,960
is that 1 minus v
squared is equal to u

318
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,927
divided by x squared.

319
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,510
That's what I had
figured out earlier,

320
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,940
that I just forgot when I
was staring at the board.

321
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,530
And to notice that, what
do we have to remember?

322
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,730
u is x squared minus y squared,
so if I divide everything

323
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,220
by x squared, the
first term is 1

324
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,880
and the second
term is v squared.

325
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,879
So, whew, that's good.

326
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,670
So I was a little
nervous there for second,

327
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,150
but I did in fact
do this earlier.

328
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,360
And I'd forgotten what I did.

329
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,930
So now, the 1 minus v
squared is actually the same

330
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,970
as u divided by x squared.

331
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,930
And notice what that
does to this term here.

332
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:20,770
That tells us that dx*dy over
x squared is actually equal

333
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:29,710
to du*dv over-- instead
of the 1 minus v squared,

334
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,610
I put u over x squared
and I get-- notice,

335
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,100
I get an x squared times
2, u divided by x squared.

336
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,600
Right?

337
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,070
I just replace the 1 minus v
squared with what I know it is,

338
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,604
the x squareds divide out,
and so I get du*dv over 2u.

339
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:50,520
So now the good news is
I have all the pieces,

340
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,470
because I'm about to
run out of board space.

341
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,690
So I have all the
pieces, so I'm just

342
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,800
going to put them together,
and then we're done.

343
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,620
So let me come here
in the final spot,

344
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,570
and say this is
our final answer.

345
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,070
Our final answer is that
we're integrating u from 1,

346
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:15,910
to 1 over v minus v. And then
we're integrating v from 0

347
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,350
to a-- where a is the value
I determined earlier--

348
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:26,110
of 1 over 2u, du*dv.

349
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,330
So this is the
final, final answer.

350
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,287
This was a long one.

351
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:33,620
And I'm sorry I had a little
brain freeze in the middle.

352
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,060
I couldn't remember how
I'd fixed that problem.

353
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,140
So what I did at
that point-- I just

354
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,780
want to point out that when I
was working on this problem,

355
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,870
and I had a 1 minus v
squared, I knew somehow

356
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,180
I had to figure out
how to relate that

357
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,560
and the x squared
in terms of u and v.

358
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,010
And so I actually
saw this expression.

359
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,895
I could have written
it better, maybe, as x

360
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,970
squared times this equals u.

361
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,470
OK.

362
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,830
And maybe that would
have been more obvious,

363
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,020
if that's the case.

364
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,130
But that was really
the step that

365
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,740
allowed me to
replace all of this

366
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,379
by things in terms
of u and v. Which

367
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,920
I know I should have
been able to do,

368
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,555
it's just a matter
of figuring it out.

369
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,180
So let me just go
back to the beginning

370
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,470
and remind you of each of
the steps very briefly,

371
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,900
and then we'll be done.

372
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,510
So we come back over
to the beginning.

373
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,090
We were starting with change
of variables supplied for us.

374
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,510
We already had an integral
in terms of x and y,

375
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,560
and we had an infinite region.

376
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,260
And what we were
asked to do is find

377
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,770
the limits and the integrand.

378
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,170
So the first step
for me is I always

379
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,980
find it very helpful to draw
the region in the xy-plane,

380
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,500
and then draw the new
region in the uv-plane.

381
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,470
Neither one of them
has to be perfect,

382
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,750
but the understanding of the
values of the curves in terms

383
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,780
of equations of u and v are very
important, to understand that.

384
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,370
That gives you the
bounds, the limits.

385
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,797
And then, so we
did all this work.

386
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:00,630
We found the limits.

387
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,338
There was a little
algebra in the middle.

388
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,270
We found the limits.

389
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,780
And then we found
the Jacobian, which

390
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,640
was going to tell us how
the variables were changing.

391
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
We found it in terms of x and y.

392
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,520
We rewrote it in
terms of u and v.

393
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,870
And so when we came back and we
compared what our integrand was

394
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,424
initially, we could
compare dx*dy to du*dv.

395
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:26,840
But then we also
had to figure out

396
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,170
how to replace the
1 over x squared.

397
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,550
So once we did all that, we had
everything in terms of u and v,

398
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,045
and then we finally had what
the integrand was going to be.

399
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,265
So there were a lot of steps,
but this was ultimately

400
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,140
what the problem was.

401
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,830
And again, I'll just point
out, this is the final solution

402
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,620
right here.

403
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,780
We integrated from 1, to
1 over v minus v, for u.

404
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,970
And we integrated from 0 to a
in v, the function 1 over 2u.

405
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,470
OK.

406
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,497
That is where I will stop.
