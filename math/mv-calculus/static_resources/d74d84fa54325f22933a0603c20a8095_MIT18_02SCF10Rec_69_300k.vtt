JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.330
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.510
I've got a nice exercise here
on Stokes' Theorem for you.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.450
Now this problem is a little bit
more sophisticated than a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630
lot of problems we've been
doing in recitation.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.400
So it requires a little bit
more thought, and it also

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.940
involves more mathematical
sophistication.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.230
So we're doing a clever kind
of proof here that I like.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.330
So hopefully you'll
like this one.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.310
It's a little bit in a different
style than some of

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.600
the ones we've done.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.860
So I think I need to talk about
it a little bit before

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.630
we get started.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.580
So let's let F be the
field x, y, z.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.180
So this is our radial field
that we've seen a lot in

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.870
recitation.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.510
So what I'd like you to do is
prove that this field is not

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.200
the curl of any field
G. All right.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.450
So I'd like you to show that
there's no field G such that F

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.790
is equal to the curl of G.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.750
Now, rather than just saying
that to you and letting you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.760
run off, I have a suggestion
for an interesting way you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.750
could go about this.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.340
And this interesting way is
going to use Stokes' Theorem.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.400
So what I'd like you to do is
a proof by contradiction.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.020
OK, so what you're going to do
is you're going to assume that

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.740
F is a curl.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.240
OK?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.020
So you're going to assume that
there is some G such that F is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.750
curl G. And then you're going
to use that to get a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.890
ridiculous conclusion.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.090
So you're going to start with
that premise, and you're going

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960
to end up with a
contradiction.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.540
So these two arrows colliding
into each other is a symbol

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.810
that mathematicians use
for a contradiction.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.035
So you're going to start from
this premise, and you're going

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:50.460
to reach a contradiction.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.200
And what that's going
to show is that your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.300
premise couldn't be right.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.570
Yeah?

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.670
Because if you start from a true
premise, well then all

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.050
your conclusions should
be true as well.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.170
So if you reach a false
conclusion, then you must have

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.470
had a false premise.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.170
So what you're going to do is
you're going to take a sphere

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.590
of radius b centered
at the origin.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.750
And a curve C on the sphere.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.640
You know, a simple,
closed curve.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.230
So assuming that F is this curl
of G, what I'd like you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.620
to do is use Stokes' Theorem to
interpret the line integral

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.170
of G dot dr over C in
two different ways.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.110
OK?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.070
And interpreting this line
integral in two different

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.660
ways, you're going to reach a
contradiction, and that will

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.130
show that F really
isn't a curl.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.760
So that's what I'd
like you to do.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.320
So why don't you pause the
video, go ahead and see if you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.410
can work that out, come
back, and we'll

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.660
talk about it together.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.910
I hope you enjoyed working
on this problem.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.320
Let's get started on it.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.810
So as I was saying before we
started, what we're going to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.280
do is we're looking for a
proof by contradiction.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.205
So as the problem says, we're
going to start with a sphere.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.170
And I'm going to take
this curve C--

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.700
some simply connected closed
curve that's going to go

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.360
around the back of the sphere,
and it's going to be oriented

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780
one way or the other-- and
it's going to divide this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.580
sphere into two pieces.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.050
So there's the one cap on
one side of it, S1.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.020
And then there's--

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.950
whatever the other piece on
the other side of it--

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.430
S2.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.030
OK.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.480
And so what we're going to do is
we're going to think about,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.140
what is this line integral?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.420
OK.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.340
So this is our curve C
here on the sphere.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:55.200
So the integral over C of G dot
dr. So this is what the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.910
problem suggests
we think about.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.510
So this is a line integral of
a field dot dr over the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.640
boundary of two surfaces.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.890
Right?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.490
C is the boundary of S1,
and C-- if we orient

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.750
it the other way--

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.730
is the boundary of S2, when we
orient them both outwards.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.660
OK, so what is this?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.460
So Stokes' Theorem tells
us something

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.470
about this line integral.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.300
So let's first think about
this as the top cap--

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.720
that cap S1--

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.770
with boundary C oriented
so that they

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.720
agree with each other.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.350
So the normal is outwards
on the sphere, and C is

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.980
proceeding in the direction
that I've

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.390
drawn the arrow here.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.810
Well, in that circumstance, we
have that the integral around

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.790
C of G dot dr by Stokes'
Theorem is equal to the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:03.030
surface integral over S1 of curl
of G dot n with respect

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.970
to surface area.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.210
Right?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.290
So this is just Stokes'
Theorem.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.380
Stokes' Theorem says the line
integral of G around the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.945
boundary curve is equal to the
surface integral of the curl

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.710
of G over the region,
provided all of our

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.460
orientations are correct.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.870
OK.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.470
Well, we know though what
curl of G is, because by

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.952
assumption, F is equal to curl
of G. OK, so this is equal to

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:36.050
the surface integral over
S1 of F dot n dS.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.300
So in the first step, we
use Stokes' Theorem.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.300
In the second step, we use our
assumption that curl G is

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.410
equal to F. Well, now what.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.550
But we know what F is.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.750
Right?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.430
F is this radial
field x, y, z.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.760
So F and n are pointing
in the same direction.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.580
They're parallel to each other.
n is a unit vector, so

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.890
this is just the length of F.
This F dot n is just the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.450
length of F. And since we're
on a sphere of radius b,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.310
this is just b.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.680
OK, so the integrand
is just b.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:17.940
So this is the integral over S1
of b dS, which is b times

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.580
the area of S1.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.930
OK.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.240
One thing I'd like you to notice
is that in particular,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.250
this is a positive number.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.410
b is positive and the
area is positive.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.840
OK.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150
So that's our first
interpretation.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.830
So we take our field G that
we suppose exists, and we

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.550
integrate it around this curve
C, and we apply Stokes'

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.720
Theorem, and then the fact that
we know what F is means

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.290
that we know what F dot n is,
and so that makes our surface

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.860
integral very easy to compute.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.730
And it turns out to be b times
the area of S, which I just

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.360
happened to notice is
a positive number.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.140
OK.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.210
Well, now we can do the
same trick on the

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.210
other half of the sphere.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.480
Right?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.160
So we just did the
top cap here.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.100
We did S1.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.920
So now we have the bottom
cap, or whatever.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.180
All the rest of the
sphere, S2.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.450
OK.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.050
So we can also get the integral
over C of G dot dr.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.200
We can interpret it in terms
of Stokes' Theorem.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.530
But notice then that in
C we still want to

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.390
use the same normal.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.140
We like outwards pointing
normals.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.190
So we're going to have to orient
C the other way in

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.480
order to make Stokes'
Theorem make sense.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.730
So let's walk over here
where we have

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.760
some empty board space.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.160
So we want to orient
C the other way.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.730
So in other words, we're going
to take the negative of this

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.070
line integral.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:53.170
So it's minus G dot dr. And if
we apply Stokes' Theorem to

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.940
this line integral-- so this is
the same line integral, but

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.290
with the opposite orientation
on C and so with

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.530
the opposite sign--

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:08.720
by Stokes' Theorem, this is
equal to the integral over S2

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:16.520
of the curl of G dot n dS.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.350
And so the way I've set this up,
this is still my outward

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.730
pointing normal.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.550
OK.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.580
But again, we can use our
assumption and we can get curl

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.170
of G is equal to F, because
we're assuming

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.760
that G has this property.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:43.220
So this is equal to the integral
over S2 of F dot n

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.340
with respect to surface area.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.990
And again, n is the outward
pointing normal, and F is

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.350
parallel to it.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.430
So this dot product is just the
length of F. The outward

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.930
pointing unit normal.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.050
So this is just the length
of F, which is b.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:04.120
So this is equal to b times
the area of S2,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.880
which is also positive.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.730
So what have we just shown?

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.150
Well, we started from the
assumption that there exists a

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.800
G such that F is the curl of
G. And starting from that

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.480
assumption--

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.430
let's look--

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:25.940
we showed that the line integral
around C of G dot dr

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.170
is equal to some positive
number.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:34.580
And we also showed, over here,
that the negative of the line

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.300
integral of G around C is equal
to some positive number.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.700
Well, this is clearly absurd.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.420
That can't be true.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.950
So starting from our assumption
that F was the curl

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.990
of G-- that there is a G such
the F is the curl of G--

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.590
we reached an absurd
conclusion.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.970
We reached a conclusion that
the same number is both

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.210
positive and negative.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.280
But that can't happen.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.730
So that means our premise
had to be false.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.360
OK.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.610
So this is a contradiction.

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:24.230
So our assumption is false.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.690
And our assumption that we used
to get this whole thing

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.170
started was that F was the curl
of some G. All right.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.310
So what have we shown?

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.530
So we used a nice argument here
with Stokes' Theorem in

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.080
order to show that certain
fields aren't the curl of

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.930
other fields.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.370
So Stokes' Theorem limits the
kind of fields that can be

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.630
curls of other fields.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.170
Now perhaps, you may have
thought of other theorems that

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.520
you can use that also
limit what sorts of

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.930
fields can be curls.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.090
And so there are other ways to
reach this true conclusion

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.500
that our field F--

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.760
whose components are x,
y, and z-- is not

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.310
the curl of any field.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.700
This isn't the only way to
reach that conclusion.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.680
But this is a nice way that
shows that Stokes' Theorem

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.820
puts some limitations on what
fields can behave like if

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.380
they're going to be curls.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.190
I'll stop there.
