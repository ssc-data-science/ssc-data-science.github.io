DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:12.830
The problem I'd like to work
with you right now is we have

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.210
a line which goes through two
points that are given to us

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.900
explicitly, and we have a plane
which is given to us by

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.830
an equation.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.780
And what we want to know is
where does this line intersect

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.900
this plane?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.480
And so one thing I would suggest
to get started is we

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.530
need to give a parametrization
of our line to get started.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800
OK, so why don't you work on
that, pause the tape, and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.290
we'll come back in a moment
and work it out together.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.570
OK, welcome back.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750
Let's get started.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.480
So let's start off by
drawing a cartoon of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.370
what's going on here.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.240
So we have this plane
sitting in space.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.230
And we have some line kind
of going through space.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.480
So maybe it's like this.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350
And there's this single
point of intersection.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.390
So even from the cartoon, we can
kind of, sort of see two

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.890
things which are going on.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.430
Which is that we would expect a
point of intersection, or we

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.810
would expect exactly one, if
we choose kind of a generic

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.260
line and generic plane.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.420
In order for there to be no
points of intersection, we

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420
would have to have a line which
was parallel to the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.110
plane, which is very unlikely.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.060
And then otherwise, we expect
exactly just one point of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.760
intersection.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.050
So I want to break this sort
of into two components.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:02:01.030
So we have an equation
for the plane.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.660
And when I see an equation
describing a plane, I think of

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.830
that as a sort of test
for membership.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.460
We can plug in a point--
x, y, z--

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.260
to the equation, and we can ask,
does this point make the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.250
equation true, or doesn't it?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.900
And if it does, then that point
x, y, z is in the plane,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.140
and otherwise it's
not in the plane.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.490
For the line, what we're going
to need to do in a second is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.770
we're going to need to come
up with a parametrization.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.110
And a parametrization is a
different kind of thing than

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.600
an equation describing a line.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.960
A parametrization, rather than
being a test for membership,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.620
is really a way of listing all
the points on the line.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.130
So when we give a
parametrization--

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.100
in a second-- then we're going
to be able to list all the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.430
points in the line.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.210
And then we're going to be able
to plug our list into the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.820
equation for the plane, and find
out which point on our

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.580
list is actually in the plane.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.480
Which one satisfies the
membership equation.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.190
So why don't we get
started first with

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.900
parametrizing the line.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.590
So the general kind of picture
here is we have a point P1 in

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.500
space, and we have another point
P2 in space, and we want

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.910
to parametrize the line which
goes between them.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.680
And there's actually a very
simple way to do this.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.680
What we do is we want to take
our original point P1, and we

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.510
want to add a variable t times
the vector P2 minus P1, which

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.150
connects them.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.560
So that's this one here.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.940
OK.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.220
So this is a reasonable thing to
do, because if we plug in t

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.510
equals 0, then we just get P1.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.100
And if we plug in t equals
1, then we get P1

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.830
plus P2 minus P1.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.190
We just get P2.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.090
So this line definitely goes
through those two points, and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.020
that's all that we
really need.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.880
So in our specific problem
here, we have P1--

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.660
we can take to be the
first point--

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.470
0, minus 1, 1.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.090
And then we have t times--

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.090
so we have 2 minus 0 is--

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.020
2--

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.040
3 minus a negative 1 is--

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.830
4--

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.590
and 3 minus 1 is--

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.170
2.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.590
And this is the vector
connecting those.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.920
And so we can write, we can just
combine these two and we

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:54.730
get 2t, 4t minus 1,
and 2t plus 1.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.380
OK?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:07.680
So this here is a
parametrization of the line.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.770
So as we vary t-- now, walking
back over to our picture-- as

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.240
we vary t, we're going to
just be listing all the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.490
points on the line.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.180
And we're going to ask, for
which point are we actually

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.490
contained in the plane?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.230
So let's go over to the board
over here and solve that.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.090
So what we want to know is does
this point satisfy the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.340
equation for the plane?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.650
And our plane was given to us
by the equation 2x plus y

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.870
minus z equals 1.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.940
So x on our line is 2t.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.920
So we have 2 times 2t, plus--

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.610
y is--

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.060
4t minus 1, minus--

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.920
z is--

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.700
2t plus 1.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.940
And all this is meant
to equal 1.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.280
OK.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:15.650
So if we expand this out, we get
4t plus another 4t minus

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.880
2t and we get--

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.160
minus 1 minus another 1--

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.490
so we get minus 2 equals 1.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:34.820
So altogether we get 6t equals
3, so that tells

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.070
us that t is 1/2.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.910
OK?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.900
And finally, to get our answer,
we need to go back

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.220
over to our parametrization
of the line and

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.170
plug in t equals 1/2.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:59.020
So coming back over here,
plugging in t

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.560
equals 1/2, we get 1--

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.300
2 minus 1 is--

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.680
1--

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.330
and 1 plus 1 is--

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.580
2.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.090
OK, so we get the point of
intersection 1, 1, 2.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.200
So that was quite a few steps,
so let's review what we did.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.650
So to begin with, we needed to
understand that the equation

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.170
for a plane is a test
for membership.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.270
It's not a list of all the
points in the plane, it's a

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.750
test for membership.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.490
The parametrization of the line,
on the other hand, is a

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.320
way of listing all of the
points on the line.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.740
And so if our goal is to find
which particular point on the

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.980
line is contained in the
plane, then we need to

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.510
parametrize our line, and then
we need to plug in our

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.050
parametrization to our equation
for the plane, and

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.700
then solve for the value of
t which makes it true.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.230
Finding that t then we've,
that's is equivalent to

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.061
finding a point on our line.

00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.440
And I think I'll leave
it at that.
