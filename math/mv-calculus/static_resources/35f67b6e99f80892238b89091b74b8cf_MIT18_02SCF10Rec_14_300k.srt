DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:12,830
The problem I'd like to work
with you right now is we have

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,210
a line which goes through two
points that are given to us

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,900
explicitly, and we have a plane
which is given to us by

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,830
an equation.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,780
And what we want to know is
where does this line intersect

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,900
this plane?

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,480
And so one thing I would suggest
to get started is we

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,530
need to give a parametrization
of our line to get started.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,800
OK, so why don't you work on
that, pause the tape, and

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,290
we'll come back in a moment
and work it out together.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,910

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,570
OK, welcome back.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,750
Let's get started.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,480
So let's start off by
drawing a cartoon of

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,370
what's going on here.

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,240
So we have this plane
sitting in space.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,230
And we have some line kind
of going through space.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
So maybe it's like this.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,960

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,350
And there's this single
point of intersection.

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,390
So even from the cartoon, we can
kind of, sort of see two

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,890
things which are going on.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,430
Which is that we would expect a
point of intersection, or we

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,810
would expect exactly one, if
we choose kind of a generic

27
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,260
line and generic plane.

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,420
In order for there to be no
points of intersection, we

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
would have to have a line which
was parallel to the

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,110
plane, which is very unlikely.

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,060
And then otherwise, we expect
exactly just one point of

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,760
intersection.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,050
So I want to break this sort
of into two components.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:02:01,030
So we have an equation
for the plane.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,660
And when I see an equation
describing a plane, I think of

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,830
that as a sort of test
for membership.

37
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,460
We can plug in a point--
x, y, z--

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,260
to the equation, and we can ask,
does this point make the

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,250
equation true, or doesn't it?

40
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,900
And if it does, then that point
x, y, z is in the plane,

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,140
and otherwise it's
not in the plane.

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,490
For the line, what we're going
to need to do in a second is

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,770
we're going to need to come
up with a parametrization.

44
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,680

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,110
And a parametrization is a
different kind of thing than

46
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,600
an equation describing a line.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,960
A parametrization, rather than
being a test for membership,

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,620
is really a way of listing all
the points on the line.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,130
So when we give a
parametrization--

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,100
in a second-- then we're going
to be able to list all the

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,430
points in the line.

52
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,210
And then we're going to be able
to plug our list into the

53
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,820
equation for the plane, and find
out which point on our

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,580
list is actually in the plane.

55
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,480
Which one satisfies the
membership equation.

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,190
So why don't we get
started first with

57
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,900
parametrizing the line.

58
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,590
So the general kind of picture
here is we have a point P1 in

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,500
space, and we have another point
P2 in space, and we want

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,910
to parametrize the line which
goes between them.

61
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,680
And there's actually a very
simple way to do this.

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,680
What we do is we want to take
our original point P1, and we

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,510
want to add a variable t times
the vector P2 minus P1, which

64
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,150
connects them.

65
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,560
So that's this one here.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,940
OK.

67
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,220
So this is a reasonable thing to
do, because if we plug in t

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,510
equals 0, then we just get P1.

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,100
And if we plug in t equals
1, then we get P1

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,830
plus P2 minus P1.

71
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,190
We just get P2.

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,090
So this line definitely goes
through those two points, and

73
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,020
that's all that we
really need.

74
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,880
So in our specific problem
here, we have P1--

75
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,660
we can take to be the
first point--

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,470
0, minus 1, 1.

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,090
And then we have t times--

78
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,090
so we have 2 minus 0 is--

79
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,020
2--

80
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,040
3 minus a negative 1 is--

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,830
4--

82
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,590
and 3 minus 1 is--

83
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,170
2.

84
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,590
And this is the vector
connecting those.

85
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,920
And so we can write, we can just
combine these two and we

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:54,730
get 2t, 4t minus 1,
and 2t plus 1.

87
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,540

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,380
OK?

89
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:07,680
So this here is a
parametrization of the line.

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,770
So as we vary t-- now, walking
back over to our picture-- as

91
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,240
we vary t, we're going to
just be listing all the

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,490
points on the line.

93
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,180
And we're going to ask, for
which point are we actually

94
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,490
contained in the plane?

95
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,230
So let's go over to the board
over here and solve that.

96
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,090
So what we want to know is does
this point satisfy the

97
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,340
equation for the plane?

98
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,270

99
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,650
And our plane was given to us
by the equation 2x plus y

100
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,870
minus z equals 1.

101
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,940
So x on our line is 2t.

102
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,920
So we have 2 times 2t, plus--

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,610
y is--

104
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,060
4t minus 1, minus--

105
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,920
z is--

106
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,700
2t plus 1.

107
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,940
And all this is meant
to equal 1.

108
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,280
OK.

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:15,650
So if we expand this out, we get
4t plus another 4t minus

110
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,880
2t and we get--

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,160
minus 1 minus another 1--

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,490
so we get minus 2 equals 1.

113
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:34,820
So altogether we get 6t equals
3, so that tells

114
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,070
us that t is 1/2.

115
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,150

116
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,910
OK?

117
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,900
And finally, to get our answer,
we need to go back

118
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,220
over to our parametrization
of the line and

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,170
plug in t equals 1/2.

120
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:59,020
So coming back over here,
plugging in t

121
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,560
equals 1/2, we get 1--

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,760

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,300
2 minus 1 is--

124
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,680
1--

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,330
and 1 plus 1 is--

126
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,580
2.

127
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,240

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,090
OK, so we get the point of
intersection 1, 1, 2.

129
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,200
So that was quite a few steps,
so let's review what we did.

130
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,650
So to begin with, we needed to
understand that the equation

131
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,170
for a plane is a test
for membership.

132
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,270
It's not a list of all the
points in the plane, it's a

133
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,750
test for membership.

134
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,490
The parametrization of the line,
on the other hand, is a

135
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,320
way of listing all of the
points on the line.

136
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,740
And so if our goal is to find
which particular point on the

137
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,980
line is contained in the
plane, then we need to

138
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,510
parametrize our line, and then
we need to plug in our

139
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,050
parametrization to our equation
for the plane, and

140
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,700
then solve for the value of
t which makes it true.

141
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,230
Finding that t then we've,
that's is equivalent to

142
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,061
finding a point on our line.

143
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,440
And I think I'll leave
it at that.

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,684
