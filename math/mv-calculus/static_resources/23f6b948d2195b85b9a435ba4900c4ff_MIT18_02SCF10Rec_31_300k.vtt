DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.110
So in this problem, we're
considering a function f of

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.910
three variables f of x, y, z,
and it's differentiable, and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820
we're not told a
formula for f.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.010
We just know that it's
differential at this point P,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.650
which is 1 minus 1, 1, and we're
told that the gradient

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.410
of f at that point is this
particular vector 2i plus j

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.170
minus 3k at that point P. So all
we understand about f is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.960
how it looks around
the point P.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.300
Now, we also have this
relation between the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.280
variables, so x, y and
z aren't unrelated.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.460
They're related by this
constraint that z is x squared

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.750
plus y plus 1.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.640
So with this information, we
want to compute the gradient

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.520
of a new function g, and the new
function g is a function

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.590
of two variables, and this
function g is obtained from f

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
by just plugging in our
relation for y.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.380
So we can use our constraint to
solve for y, and then this

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.730
function g is just f with
that constraint applied.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.690
And what we really want to
do is we want to find the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.750
gradient of g at
the point 1, 1.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.410
So notice that when g is equal
to 1, 1, that means that--

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.070
sorry, when the input of g is 1,
1, that means the input of

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.350
f is P. OK?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.680
So why don't you pause
the video and work

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.150
this out for yourself.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.920
Check back with me and we'll
work it out together.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.670
OK, welcome back.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.920
So let's get started.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.840
So this problem may not look
like it's a problem about

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410
partial derivatives with
constraints, but that's what

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.370
it's really going to boil down
to, which is to say that when

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.620
we want to compute--

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.800
so when we want to answer this
question by computing the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.870
gradient, the first thing we're
going to want to do is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.180
compute the partial derivative
of g and its variable x.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.760
And from the way we set up the
problem, that's just the same

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.120
as computing the partial
derivative of f with respect

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.810
to x and keeping z constant.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.560
Now, remember, when we do
partial derivatives with

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.800
constraints, what's important
about the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.950
notation is what's missing.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.110
The variable y is missing, and
that's because we are going to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.430
use the constraint to get rid of
it, and that's exactly how

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.710
we define g, so this is
the key observation.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.100
So computing the gradient of g
is just going to be computing

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.095
these partial derivatives
with constraints.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.320
So we'll do that in a moment,
and I'll also just write that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.080
the partial derivative of g in
the z-direction is partial f

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.970
partial z, now keeping
x constrained.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.900
All right, so we need to
compute these partial

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.150
derivatives with constraints.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.560
And so you remember
how this goes.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.680
The way that I prefer to do this
is to compute the total

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.310
differentials.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.405
So let's compute over here.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.860
The total differential df is--

00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:05.600
the total differential of f is
just the partials of f in the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.810
x-direction, f in the
y-direction, f in the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.410
z-direction, and each of these
is multiplied by the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.690
corresponding differential.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.890
And we don't know f, so we
can't compute the partial

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.010
derivatives of it in general,
but we do know these partial

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.700
derivatives at this point.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.780
And so in the problem, we were
given that this is 2dx

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.590
plus dy minus 3dz.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.020
So this is just using the fact
that the gradient of f we were

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:49.410
given is 2, 1 minus 3, OK?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.530
So that's the total differential
of f, and now we

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.115
have this constraint.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:54.730
And remember, when we do these
partial derivatives with

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.180
constraints, the trick is to
take the differential of the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.330
constraint.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.430
So we had this equation z equals
x squared plus y plus

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.730
1, and what we need to do is
take its differential.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:17.320
So we have dz is
2x dx plus dy.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.440
So that's our constraint.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.780
Now here we have this variable
x, but we're not varying x in

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.150
this problem.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.570
We're only focused on the
point P, and at the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.430
point P, x is 1.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:39.630
So, in fact, dz is just
2dx plus dy, OK?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.290
So now what we need to do is
we need to combine the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:54.770
constraint equation and the
total differential for f into

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.320
one equation, and so this is
just linear algebra now.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.840
So I'll just come over here.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:11.580
So we can rewrite our total
differential for the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:24.160
constraint as saying that dy is
equal to dz minus 2dx, and

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.900
then we can plug that
back into our total

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.480
differential for f.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.470
And so we get that df is
equal to 2dx plus--

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.980
now I plug in dy here--

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:46.286
so dz minus 2dx, and then
finally, minus 3dz.

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:51.560
So altogether, I get a
minus 2dz, because

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.712
this and this cancel.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.080
OK.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.920
We get a minus 2dz.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.170
So what does that tell us
about the gradient?

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.570
So remember that the
differential now of g and its

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:20.700
variables is partial
g partial x dx plus

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.490
partial g partial z dz.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.120
And remember, the trick about
partial derivatives and their

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.850
relation to total differentials
is that the

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.080
partial derivative is just
this coefficient.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.920
So the fact that we computed
df and we found that it was

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:48.010
minus 2dz, that tells
us that dg--

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.510
so the thing that we need to
use is that g, remember, is

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.720
just the specialization of f.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.170
So dg is equal to df in this
case, because g is just a

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.620
special case of f with
constraints.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.940
So when we computed df here, we
were imposing exactly the

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.380
constraints that we used to
define dg, and so what this

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.810
tells us is that we can just
compare the coefficients here

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:27.110
and so our gradient
is 0 minus 2.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.800
So the 0 is because there is no
dependence anymore on x at

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.740
this point.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.190
There wasn't a dx term.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.710
There could have been
and there wasn't.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:39.370
And the minus 2 is because
that's the dependence on z.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.850
OK, so this is a bit
complicated, so why don't we

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.210
review what we did.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:50.750
So going back over to the
problem statement, we first

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:59.820
needed to realize that saying
that g was a special case of f

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:05.680
where we use our constraints
to solve for y, that's what

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.650
put us in the context of
problems with constraints.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.750
So the fact that the dependence
on y was so simple

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.837
that we could just use
the constraint.

00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:17.087
OK.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.750
So then, what that allowed us to
do is it allowed us to say

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.270
that the partial derivative of
g in the x-direction is just

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.190
the partial derivative in the
x-direction subject to the

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.650
constraint, and that's
what we did here.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.790
And so then, the next steps that
we did are the same steps

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.880
that we would always do to
compute partial derivatives

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:48.380
with constraints, and so we
finally got a relationship

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.730
that said that, subject to these
constraints, df is equal

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.890
to minus 2dz.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.460
And the point is that g is just
the function f with those

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.400
constraints imposed, and so dg
and df are the same, and so,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.360
in particular, dg
is minus 2dz.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.200
And then, we remember that you
can always read off partial

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.670
derivatives from the
total differential.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.140
They're just the coefficients.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.545
And so in the end, we got that
the gradient was 0 minus 2.

00:10:18.545 --> 00:10:21.010
And I think I'll leave
it at that.
