00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,930

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,162
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:11,370
In this video I'd like us
to work on the following

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,660
application for spherical
coordinates.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,670
So what I'd like us to do is
find the gravitational

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,690
attraction of an upper solid
half sphere of radius a and

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,700
center o, that's the
gravitational attraction on a

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,670
mass m naught at o.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,880
So the m naught is sitting at o,
we have a solid half sphere

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,490
of radius a and center o,
and we want to find the

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,180
gravitational attraction of the
half sphere on the mass.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,930
And we're going to assume that
the density delta is equal to

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,280
the square root of x squared
plus y squared.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,140
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while to

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,590
work on it, and when you feel
good about your solution bring

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,170
the video back up, I'll
show you what I did.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:55,070

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,300
OK.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,380
Welcome back.

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,160
Again what we're going to do
is we're going to do an

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,640
application problem.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,635
And what we have is we have
the solid half sphere of

23
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,630
radius a and center o, and we
want to know the gravitational

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,680
attraction of it on
a mass m naught.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,080
So the first thing I'm going to
do is draw a picture, just

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,240
so I can get myself oriented.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,630
The easiest thing to do--
obviously, when I'm going to

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,510
try and figure this out, I'm
going to use spherical

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,320
coordinates.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,860
I have an upper solid half
sphere, so that should tell me

31
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,680
spherical coordinates
will be good.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,160
And the easiest way to deal with
spherical coordinates is

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,470
obviously to choose o
to be the origin.

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,960
So I'm going to have m naught
sitting right at the origin.

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,820
And then I'm going to have--
oops, I should write that

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,430
somewhere else.

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,130
Maybe, well, I'll just leave it
there-- and then I'm going

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,170
to have the solid half sphere,
which I'm going to just draw

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,950
sort of like this.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,360
Maybe that doesn't look
like a sphere to you.

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
But we have the solid half
sphere and it's exerting a

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
force on m naught.

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,170
And if I want to know the force,
how we denote the force

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,680
in lecture was the components
were the x component of the

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,900
force, the y component of
the force, and the z

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,410
component of the force.

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,340
And so I want to point out
these are not partial

48
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,820
derivatives.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,000
This is the standard notation
you use for force in this

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,530
case, and so these are not
the partial derivatives.

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,910
They're just the x
component, the y

52
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,530
component, and the z component.

53
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,420
And if you notice, this upper
solid half sphere--

54
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,440
because of where m naught is--

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,270
the x component and the y
component of the force are 0

56
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,530
based on symmetry.

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,310
So all I really need to worry
about is the z component.

58
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,715
I'm only really interested in
one component of the force and

59
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:31,950
it's the z component.

60
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,370
Because the other two are going
to be 0, just by the

61
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,300
symmetry of this solid
half sphere.

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,840
So I really only need
the z component.

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,065
So what I have to do in order
to calculate the force is I

64
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:46,030
have to figure out the magnitude
and the direction.

65
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,520
So let's write down the
two components.

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,310
These were given to
you in class.

67
00:02:49,310 --> 00:03:00,400
So the magnitude is going to
be equal to G m naught dm

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,120
divided by rho squared.

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,850
So this was given to you
in class already.

70
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,770
So G is some constant; m naught
is the mass you have;

71
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,410
dm, we have to determine a
little bit about it; and then

72
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,740
we're dividing by rho squared.

73
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,590
And the direction--

74
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,450
because I'm only interested
in the z component--

75
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,930
the direction is just z, but
then I want to make sure that

76
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,460
the direction component
is z divided by rho.

77
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,910
The full direction is x, y, z
divided by rho but I'm only

78
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,230
interested in that
last component.

79
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,340
So the z component is
just z over rho.

80
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,170
If that confused you, I just
want to remind you that you

81
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,010
had x, y, z over rho is the full
direction of the force,

82
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,130
we're just pulling off
the z component.

83
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,610
So what we're going to be trying
to figure out-- we need

84
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,280
to integrate the product of
these two things but I need to

85
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,970
figure out what dm
actually is.

86
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,110
So let me remind you also what
dm is and then we'll put it

87
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,180
all together.

88
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,140
dm, to remind you, is supposed
to be the density times dV.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,620
And the density in this case was
square root of x squared

90
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,150
plus y squared, that's
just equal to r.

91
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,940
So it's just r dV. So there's
a bunch of little pieces and

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,430
now I have to put
them together.

93
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,330
So if I want to determine the
full attraction in the z

94
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,450
direction, because the other two
are 0, I just need to do

95
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,090
this triple integral.

96
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,780
I'll figure out my bounds
momentarily.

97
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,550
I'm going to leave a lot of
room to write my bounds

98
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,770
because I always run
out of room.

99
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,580
And then I just need to
integrate G m naught divided

100
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,310
by rho squared times z divided
by rho times r dV.

101
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,370
Actually I won't even do the
bounds yet because I have to

102
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,030
change everything into
polar coordinates.

103
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,460
So let's figure out
how to do that.

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,800
What is z in polar coordinates?
z in polar

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,510
coordinates we know
is rho cosine phi.

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,420
So I'm going to have
a G m naught--

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm going to keep this rho
cubed right here--

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,190
and then I'm going to have
a rho cosine phi.

109
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,090
r is rho sine phi, so I'll just
put another rho, and then

110
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,520
a sine phi.

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:20,320
And then dV is rho squared sine
phi d rho d phi d theta.

112
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,870
So what I'm going
to do here is--

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,200
I have to add in a rho
squared, so I'm just

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,220
going to cube this.

115
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,240
And another sine phi, so I'm
going to square that.

116
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,940
And then I'm going to have
a d rho d phi d theta.

117
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,920
Hopefully that wasn't
too scary.

118
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
But the z is my rho
cosine phi.

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,540
The r is a single
rho sine phi.

120
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,190
And then dV includes a rho
squared sine phi, so I put a

121
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,120
cubed here and a squared here,
and then d rho d phi d theta.

122
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,690
So now I just have to integrate,
so I have to figure

123
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,000
out my bounds.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,170
So we're integrating
first in rho.

125
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,740
And rho, it's a sphere- a
half sphere of radius a.

126
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,830
It's a solid half sphere.

127
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,980
So I'm just integrating
from 0 up to a.

128
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,960
And then phi--

129
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,220
because it's a solid half
sphere-- phi is starting at 0

130
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,140
and it's going down until
it hits the x-y plane.

131
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,240
And so that's pi over 2.

132
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,210
We know we start at 0, we go
to pi over 2 when we go a

133
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,300
quarter turn, basically.

134
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,300
When we go 90 degrees, right?

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,320
So we go 0 to pi over 2, and
then theta-- once I've taken

136
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,110
my rho and I've gone up as far
as I can, and I've gone down

137
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,330
this way, I have to rotate
it all the way around--

138
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,510
and so theta is actually
going from 0 to 2 pi.

139
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,530

140
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,010
All right.

141
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,600
So this is my full integral
I have here.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,490
And now let's do some

143
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,400
simplifying before we integrate.

144
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,080
Notice I have a rho cubed in the
denominator here and a rho

145
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,590
cubed in the numerator there.

146
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,450
So when I integrate in rho, I
only have this single rho.

147
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,150
When I integrate that rho,
everything else is fixed.

148
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,360
So I integrate that rho, I get
a rho squared over 2, and I

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,060
evaluate it at 0 and a and so I
get an a squared over 2, as

150
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,950
integrating this part.

151
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,460
I'm going to pull all that to
the front and then write what

152
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,790
I get next.

153
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,860
Let me write what I get next.

154
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm going to have a G m
naught as a constant.

155
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,550
I'm going to be multiplying
by a squared over 2

156
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,020
from the rho integral.

157
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,640
And then I have 2
more integrals.

158
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,850
Integral from 0 to 2 pi.

159
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:24,330
And the integral from 0 to pi
over 2 of cosine phi sine

160
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,900
squared phi d phi d theta.

161
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,940
So how do I integrate
this in phi?

162
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,820
Looks like it's going to be
sine cubed phi over 3.

163
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,890
Let me just double check.

164
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,640
The derivative of that is 3 sine
squared phi cosine phi.

165
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,950
Yes.

166
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:45,490
So, this is going to be sine
cubed phi over 3 evaluated at

167
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,000
0 and pi over 2.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,290
This inner part is.

169
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,430
And so let's see what
we get there.

170
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
Sine of 0 is 0.

171
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,850
Sine of pi over 2 is 1.

172
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,350
So I just pick up a 1/3
from this integral.

173
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,960
So now I'm going to pull
that out in front.

174
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,780
So again, the thing I've written
down here is just the

175
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,950
integral of this.

176
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,290
So I just get a 1/3
out of that.

177
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,830
Let me double check.

178
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,560
Yep, sine of pi over
2 is still 1.

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,020
Good.

180
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,550
So I get a 1/3 out of that.

181
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,240
That's a constant.

182
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,670
So I'll pull that
to the front.

183
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,840
And then notice what
I'm left with.

184
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,070
I'm just integrating 0
to 2 pi of d theta.

185
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,850
Well that's just 2 pi.

186
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,280
So I've got a 1/3 from the
inside one, times a 2 pi from

187
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,310
the outside one.

188
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,330
So I just end up getting
2 pi times--

189
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,360
or 2 pi over 3, because
there's my 1/3 also--

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,000
times G m naught a
squared over 2.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,750
And if I simplify that, I
just get G m naught a

192
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,290
squared pi over 3.

193
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,270
And so if I want to know the
force of this solid half

194
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,160
sphere acting on the mass m
naught, where the mass is

195
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,060
positioned at the center of
the base of the solid half

196
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,540
sphere, it's going to be exactly
the following thing.

197
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,130

198
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,450
By symmetry, the first two
components are 0 and the last

199
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,440
component is this G m naught
a squared pi over 3.

200
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,290
And so that's my
final solution.

201
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,790
Let me just take us back and
remind us where we came from.

202
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,060
So we wanted to find the force,
the gravitational

203
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,100
attraction of this solid half
sphere that had a radius a,

204
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,180
was centered at o, and had
mass m not sitting at o.

205
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,710
And so we were interested
in drawing the

206
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,800
easiest picture possible.

207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
We're going to put o
at the origin, so m

208
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,620
naught's at the origin.

209
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,190
Then we have a solid half
sphere of radius a.

210
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,110
So this is--

211
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,320
you know, if I come all
the way out, my

212
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,280
radius length is a.

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,770
And I gave you the density
was equal to r.

214
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,915
So we know the force we're
interested in is f sub x, f

215
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:47,700
sub y, f sub z.

216
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,860
From the picture alone, we see
f sub x and f sub y are 0.

217
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,670
So we really only need
the z component.

218
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,090
So you know how to find the
magnitude and you know how to

219
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,660
find the direction of
the vector field.

220
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,090
The reason that you've divided
by rho here, just to remind

221
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,790
you, is that the direction you
want it to be a unit vector.

222
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,680
And so this is what makes
it a unit vector.

223
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,170
And so the direction
part that I'm

224
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,470
interested in is the z part.

225
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,380
So it's z over rho.

226
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,670
And so all I need to do is take
the z over rho, multiply

227
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,400
it by the magnitude, and replace
the dm by what it is

228
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,910
in terms of the volume form.

229
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,100
And in terms of the volume form,
it's the density times

230
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,240
dV and so in this case
it's just r dV.

231
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,490
So I made all those
substitutions.

232
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,840
And then all I had to do is
do a lot of replacement.

233
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,980
And that was kind of the messy
part, and then the integral's

234
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,050
fairly easy.

235
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,690
So the messy part is z I
replaced by rho cosine phi.

236
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,810
r I replaced by rho sine phi.

237
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,380
And dV I replaced by rho
squared sine phi

238
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,410
d rho d phi d theta.

239
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,430
And then I just have to figure
out what the bounds are for

240
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,300
the half sphere, solid
half sphere.

241
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,140
And then I integrate.

242
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,750
And the integration is all
ultimately one step at a time,

243
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,110
single variable.

244
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,870
And they were all fairly
simple integrals.

245
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,980
So in the end, we see that your
mass m not sitting at the

246
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,490
origin, the force exerted on it
by this solid half sphere

247
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,140
is 0, 0 comma G times m
naught times a squared

248
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,870
pi divided by 3.

249
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,150
All right, that's
where I'll stop.

250
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,939
