DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.350
In this problem, what I'd like
us to do is I'd like us to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.180
sketch the graphs in three
dimensions of these functions

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.370
so z here is a function
of x and y.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.210
On this second one, z is also
a function of x and y.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.060
It just happens not
to depend on y.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.660
When you graph these, I'd
suggest to consider slices, so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
what happens if you consider
x equals 0 or if you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.320
consider z equals 0.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.290
As you graph these, let's
see what you can do.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.950
So why don't you pause the
video, and I'll check back

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.510
with you in a moment,
and I can show you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.760
how I solved these.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.790
OK, welcome back.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.385
So why don't we start by looking
at this function: z is

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.410
the square root of x squared
plus y squared.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.360
OK, I'll try to always draw my
axes in the same way as we do

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.890
in lecture.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.340
So x is pointing towards us,
y to the right, and z up.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.360
So as I suggested, I think a
nice way to get started with

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.190
these problems is to just try
setting the variables x and y

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.800
variously equal to 0,
and then seeing--

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.220
instead of a surface in that
case, then we'll get a curve,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.920
and we'll see what
curve we get.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.510
So for instance, if we set x
equals to 0, then we just get

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.580
z is the square root of y
squared, so we just get that z

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.610
is the absolute value of y.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.880
So what that means is that
whatever this surface looks

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.070
like, we know what it looks
like if we slice it in the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.170
blackboard, in the plane
of the blackboard.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.880
We know that it just
looks like--

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.730
this is just the graph of the
function absolute value of y,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.500
z equals absolute value of y.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.220
So now, if you think about it,
what I just said works just as

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.750
well for x instead of for y.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.180
So if we were to graph this in
the xz-plane where we set y

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.190
equals to 0, then
we would get--

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.780
OK, I'm going to try
to draw this.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.260
So let me draw that
in blue, actually.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:48.240
So the blue is in the
xz-plane and the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.400
white is in the yz-plane.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.560
OK, now I think what's going to
be really illustrative is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.380
if we think about what happens
as we fix values of z.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.710
Well, obviously, if we set z
equals to 0, then there's just

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.800
one solution, which is
this point here.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.130
But what's going to be
interesting is if we set z to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.050
be some positive value.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.940
So, for instance, let's
take z to be 2.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:28.410
So, for instance, we set z
equals 2, then we get 2 equals

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.720
the square root of x squared
plus y squared.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.210
Solving this, this is the same
as saying x squared plus y

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.890
squared equals 4.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.930
So what that tells us is that
at the height z equals 2,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.270
we're just going to have
a circle of radius 2.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.180
This is just the equation for
a circle of radius 2, and so

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.480
at height 2, we just
have a circle.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.150
And actually, as you can
see, there's nothing

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.340
special about 2.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.990
At every height, we're just
going to have a circle, and so

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.647
this is what's called a cone.

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:01.897
OK.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.560
Now for b, we can expect when
we go over here to b that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.390
something funny is going to
happen because it doesn't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.180
depend on y.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.020
So let's see if we can see how
the fact that z doesn't depend

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.490
on y, how this enters
into our picture.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.760
So I'll just walk over
here, and we'll

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.365
consider z equals x squared.

00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:30.615
OK.

00:04:34.648 --> 00:04:42.810
So again, we have our x-axis,
x, y, and z axes.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.100
Now, let's consider what this
looks like when we intersect

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.470
with the xz-plane, so when
we set y equals to 0.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.690
Well, setting y equal to 0
actually doesn't change the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.770
equation, and we get
z equals x squared.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.740
So we know what that
looks like.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.990
It's a parabola.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.630
And this parabola, I want you to
think that it's, you know,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.180
coming out at us, so it's in the
xz-plane, going in and out

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.480
of the board.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.220
But now if you think about it,
what it means to say that this

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.520
function doesn't depend on y,
what that means is that we

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.800
have the exact same picture
at every value of y.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.620
So if we go out here,
then we're going to

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.670
have the same picture.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.250
And if we go over here,
we're going to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.070
have the same picture.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.980
And, in fact, what you're going
to get is you're going

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.230
to get a prism.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.440
Oh, that's really
hard to read.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.690
Let's see if we can--

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.380
so let me-- since that's a bit
hard to read on the axes,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.820
let's draw this again.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.190
What we'll get is we're going
to have a prism, which looks

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:03.340
like a parabola, looks like a
sheet that's just stretched

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.090
out in the shape
of a parabola.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.980
And so, this we could call
a prism of a parabola.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.280
Now let's see if we can get any
more insight from these

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.400
two pictures.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.110
So look what happened
in this instance.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.140
So here, the function z, it
obviously didn't depend on y.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.126
And we can see that by looking
at the graph, because, you

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:39.030
know, as you vary y, the picture
had to be unchanged.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.730
So the fact that this was a
prism in y and the fact that

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.160
the function didn't depend on
y are one and the same fact.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.175
Now if we go over
to the cone--

00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:57.820
OK, so here, our function
z very much depended

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.300
on both x and y.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.380
But you notice that it depended
on x and y only in

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.590
the sense--

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.130
so z is actually equal just to
the radius r, which is x

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.990
squared plus y squared.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.380
So the fact that this cone--

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.905
thank you-- the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.660
So the fact that this only
depends on the radius and not

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.080
the relative angle of x and y
is why we got what-- this is

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.220
an example of a surface
of revolution.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.310
So we can always expect that if
the dependence of z on the

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.290
variables x and y, if you can
actually just rewrite that as

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.060
a dependence on r, then you'll
get this nice radial symmetry,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.120
just like we had translational
symmetry for the prism.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.530
And I think I'll leave
it at that.
