JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.410
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.890
In lecture, you've been learning
about using gradients

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.290
to compute tangent planes
to surfaces.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.700
So I have an example of a
practice problem here for you.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.460
So what I'd like you to do in
part a is to use gradients to

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.930
find the tangent plane to the
surface z equals x cubed plus

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.940
3xy squared at the
point 1, 2, 13.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.690
And in part b, I'd like you to
do something similar, which is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.015
to use gradients to find the
tangent line to the curve x

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:47.010
cubed plus 2xy plus y squared
equals 9 at the point 1, 2.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.420
So why don't you pause
the video, have a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.810
couple goes at those.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.310
Come back and we can work
on them together.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.010
So hopefully, you had some good
luck working on these

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.830
problems. Let's just take
a look at them.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.010
So for part a, you're given a
function in the sort of usual

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.330
form that we use to graph it,
which is you're given z equals

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690
a function of x and y.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.780
But in order to apply this
gradient method, what we

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.680
really want is we want to look
at this surface as if it were

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.830
a level surface of some function
of three variables.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.820
So in order to do that, what
we want to do always is to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.640
bring the x, y and z all
together on the same side with

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.720
just a zero or a constant
on the other side.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.660
So let me do that.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.200
So I'm going to rewrite the
defining equation of this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:55.090
surface as 0 equals x cubed plus
3xy squared minus z, and

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.090
I'm going to define this
right-hand side to be a new

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.085
function w of x, y, z.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.830
All right?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.370
So if I call this thing w, then
our surface in question

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.680
is just a level surface of w.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.260
It's the level surface
w equals 0.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And so we know in that situation
that the gradient of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.820
w is perpendicular to
its level surfaces.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.920
It's orthogonal to its
level surfaces.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.066
So the normal to our surface is
exactly the gradient of w.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.040
All right?

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:45.880
So gradient of w is the normal
to our surface, and a normal

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.412
is what we use to write down
the equation for a tangent

00:02:48.412 --> 00:02:51.380
line-- oh, tangent
plane, excuse me.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.940
So, OK, so let's compute
the gradient of w.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.380
Well, that's not hard to do.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.340
We just take the partial
derivatives with

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.520
respect to x, y and z.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.090
So the partial derivative of
w with respect to x is 3x

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.200
squared plus 3y squared.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.510
The partial derivative with
respect to y is 6xy, and the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.100
partial derivative with respect
to z is minus 1.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.020
So one thing to notice is that
when you do this method, when

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.560
you have the function given at
z, when you have the surface

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.450
given in the form z as a
function of x and y, you're

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.900
going to bring the z over, and
you always have a minus 1

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.730
there when you set the
problem up this way.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.930
Because you'll have a minus z,
and then you'll just take the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.980
partial with respect to z, and
the other terms will only

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.200
involve x and y, so they'll
be killed by the partial

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.180
derivative.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.340
So in any case, this is our
gradient, so we want the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.150
normal vector.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.230
We were asked for the
tangent plane at a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.480
particular point, I believe.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.780
Yes, at the point 1, 2, 13.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.270
So we need to compute the
gradient at that particular

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.360
point and that will be
our normal vector.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.340
So the gradient at
this point is--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.570
well, we just plug in, so the
gradient at 1, 2, 13.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.720
So x is 1.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.660
So this is 3 times 1 plus 3
times 4, so that's going to be

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.170
15, and 6xy is 12, and minus
1 is just minus 1.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.460
So this is the gradient vector
at our point 1, 2, 13.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.220
So now we have a point, the
point 1, 2, 13, and we have

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.420
the normal vector 15, 12, minus
1, so that gives us the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.740
equation for the tangent
plane right off.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:48.590
So the equation for the tangent
plane, I just dot the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.490
normal vector with the vector
connecting our point to the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.830
point x, y, z, so that gives us
15 times-- well, our point

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.940
is 1, 2, 3-- so it's 15 times
x minus 1 plus 12 times y

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:15.460
minus 2 minus 1 times
z minus 13 equals 0.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.370
So in point-normal
form, this is the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.440
equation for that plane.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.680
Great.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.250
And if you wanted, you could
rewrite this a whole bunch of

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.110
different ways, but I'll
just leave it there.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.540
So let's do part b.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.420
I guess I'll just start
it right below here.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:43.400
So for part b, we have a curve
x cubed plus 2xy plus y

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.960
squared equals 9.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.090
So this is a curve that is
defined by this implicit

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.036
relationship between x and y.

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:51.700
All right?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.420
And so what I want
to do is I can do

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.140
exactly the same process.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.710
We're going to do exactly
the same thing.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.500
We're going to find the
normal-point form for the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.780
tangent line, and so we're going
to do that by defining a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.420
function f of x, y.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.190
In this case, it's a function of
just two variables, because

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.500
we're only working with a
curve in two dimensions.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.740
Before, we had a surface in
three dimensions so we had a

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.570
function of three variables.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.490
So f of x, y, and so then our
curve is exactly a level curve

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.080
of the graph of f, right?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.590
It's the level curve
f equals 9.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.520
So in order to find the tangent
line, I can do exactly

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.380
the same thing.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.760
I can find the gradient.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.400
The gradient is normal to the
tangent line and then I can

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.390
use normal-point form.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:48.730
So the gradient of f is-- again,
f is just a polynomial

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.190
function so its gradient
is easy to compute.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:07:02.230
It's 3x squared plus 2y
comma 2x plus 2y.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.350
And so we're interested in
this tangent line at a

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.640
particular point so we're
interested at the point 1, 2.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.520
So the gradient of f at 1, 2,
well, I just plug in again, so

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.690
I get 3 plus 4.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.120
That's 7.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.890
And 2 plus 4 is 6.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.280
And so again, the same analysis
as we used in the

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.130
tangent plane case works in
the tangent line case.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.290
Let's come over here.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:51.520
So xy is on the tangent line
if and only if we have that

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.230
the gradient dot, so that's
the gradient 7, 6 dot the

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.500
vector x minus 1, y minus 2--
this is the vector connecting

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.520
the point x, y to
our point 1, 2--

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.800
is equal to 0, if and only
if those two things are

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.730
orthogonal.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:18.210
So this is i.e., 7 times x minus
1 plus 6 times y minus 2

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.630
is equal to 0.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.100
So this is the point-normal
form for the

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.060
equation of that line.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.480
And again, you could, you know,
expand out and rewrite

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.300
this in whichever forms you
happen to like to see your

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.970
equations of lines.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.980
So there you go.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.600
Using the gradient,
we can compute

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.460
tangent planes to surfaces.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.600
Similarly, we can use the
same idea to compute

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.470
tangent lines to curves.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.810
The point is that the gradient
vector of a function is

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.310
orthogonal to the level curves
of that function.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.140
And so we use that to get the
normal vectors to our curves

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.280
or our surfaces, and with the
normal vector, we can then

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.850
easily compute the tangent plane
or the tangent line.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.770
So I'll stop there.
