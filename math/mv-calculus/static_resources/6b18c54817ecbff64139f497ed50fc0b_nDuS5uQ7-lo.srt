JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,017
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,850
In lecture, you've been
learning about using

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,750
the method of
Lagrange multipliers

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,950
to optimize functions of several
variables given a constraint.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,630
So here's a problem that you
can practice this method on.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,700
So I've got a function
f of x, y, z equals

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,970
x squared plus x plus 2 y
squared plus 3 z squared.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,490
And what I'd like you to do is
find the maximum and minimum

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,850
values that this function
takes as the point (x, y, z)

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,190
moves around the unit sphere x
squared plus y squared plus z

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,720
squared equals 1.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,200
So to optimize this function
given the constraint

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,435
x squared plus y squared
plus z squared equals 1.

15
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:44,570
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,111
to work that out, come back,
and we can work it out together.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,660
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,910
Let's have a go at it.

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,340
So remember that the
method of Lagrange

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,800
multipliers-- in order to
apply it-- what it says

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,000
is that when you have a
function being optimized

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on some constraint
condition, what

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,070
you do to find the points where
the function could be maximum

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,500
or minimum is that first
you look for points where

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,860
the gradient of your
objective function

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,380
is parallel to the gradient
of your constraint function.

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,020
So what that means is you
take the partial derivatives

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,370
f_x, f_y, f_z, and you say f_x
has to be equal to lambda times

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,120
g_x, f_y has to be equal
to lambda times g_y,

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,020
and f_z has to be
equal to lambda times

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,000
g_z, for some lambda.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then you solve
that system together

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
with the constraint equation.

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,260
And so the points
that are the solutions

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,750
of that system of
equations, those points

36
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,280
are your points that you have
to check for whether they're

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,570
the maximum or the minimum.

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,482
And also, sometimes you have
some boundary to your region

39
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,940
and you have to
check that as well.

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,850
So in this case, the sphere
doesn't have boundary.

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,627
Right?

42
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,710
So we don't have any
boundary conditions to check.

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,001
So we're going to have a
really straightforward problem

44
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,760
to solve where we
just have to look

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,970
at the partial derivatives.

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,920
So let's write down
that system of equations

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,070
that we have to solve.

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,710
So the partial derivative
of f with respect to x

49
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,810
is going to be 2x plus 1.

50
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,090
So we have to solve the
system 2x plus 1 equals--

51
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,330
and the partial derivative of
our constraint with respect

52
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,660
to x is 2x, so 2x plus 1 has
to equal lambda times 2x.

53
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,700
That's what we get from
the x-partial derivatives.

54
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,760
How about from the
y-partial derivatives?

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,550
The y-partial derivative
of f is going to be 4y.

56
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,450
So that has to be
equal to lambda

57
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,395
and the y-partial derivative
of the constraint equation

58
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,720
which is 2y.

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,710
And the z-partial
derivative of f is 6z.

60
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,280
So 6z has to be equal
to lambda times, well,

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,001
the z-partial derivative of
the constraint function, which

62
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:03,500
is 2z.

63
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,670
And we have the last equation
x squared plus y squared plus z

64
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,780
squared equals 1.

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,150
So we get four equations in
our variables x, y, and z,

66
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,664
plus this new parameter
lambda that we introduced.

67
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,080
And we want to
solve these to find

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,500
the points x, y, and z at
which these equations are all

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,240
satisfied.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,120
And then, once we
get those points,

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,985
we have to test them
to see whether they

72
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:33,000
are the maximum or the
minimum or neither.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,850
So OK.

74
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,350
So we have this
system of equations.

75
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,933
Now, this is a little
bit complicated.

76
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,500
It's not a system
of linear equations.

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,880
So we need to think about
ways that we can solve it.

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,000
And one thing that I
think we can do here,

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,660
is if you look at the
second and third equations,

80
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,780
you see that in the
second equation,

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,310
everything has a
factor of y in it.

82
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,980
So either y is equal to
0, or we can divide by it.

83
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,880
So from the second
equation, we have

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,110
that either y is
equal to 0, or we

85
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,590
can divide by y, in which case
we get lambda is equal to 2.

86
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,400
Similarly, from
the third equation,

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,610
we have that either z is equal
to 0, or we can divide by z

88
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,000
and we get lambda is equal to 3.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,485
So from the third
equation, we have z

90
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:31,750
equals 0 or lambda equals 3.

91
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,570
So now we have a bunch
of possibilities, right?

92
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,110
So either we have y equals z
equals 0, or we have y equals 0

93
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,980
and lambda equals 3, or we have
lambda equals 2 and z equals 0.

94
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,320
Or, well, the other
possibility would be lambda

95
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
equals 2 and lambda equals
3, but that can't happen.

96
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,487
So we have three possibilities.

97
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:54,570
Three different ways that
this could be satisfied.

98
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,730
So let's go over
here and write down

99
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,750
what those possibilities are.

100
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,820
So case one, or maybe
I'll call it case a.

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,190
So the case a is when y is
equal to z is equal to 0.

102
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,460
So when y is equal to
z is equal to 0-- OK,

103
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,360
we need to find x still.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,690
So let's look back
at our equations.

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,640
And when y is equal
to z is equal to 0,

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,670
well, we can solve our
constraint equation for x.

107
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,169
When y equals z equals 0, we
have that x squared equals 1.

108
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,460
So there are two possibilities.

109
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,410
The point (1, 0, 0), and
the point minus 1, 0, 0.

110
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,730
So this gives us,
in this case, we

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,160
have x equals 1 or
x equals minus 1.

112
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
So that gives us
the points (1, 0, 0)

113
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,290
and minus 1, 0, 0
that we're going

114
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,770
to have to check at the end.

115
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,270
All right.

116
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,540
So the second case is we
could have y equal to 0

117
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,880
and lambda equal to 3.

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
So in this case, let's go
back to our equations again.

119
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,020
So from lambda equals 3, we
have in our first equation

120
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,250
that 2x plus 1 equals 6x.

121
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,180
So 1 equals 4x or x equals 1/4.

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,600
So this implies over
here that x equals 1/4.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,510
And now, we still
need to find z.

124
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,190
So if we go back to our
constraint equation here,

125
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,400
we have that x is a
quarter and y is 0.

126
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,290
So that means 1/16 plus
z squared equals 1.

127
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,170
So z has to be the square
root of 15/16, plus or minus.

128
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,549
And z is equal to
plus or minus--

129
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,590
so that we can also write
that as the square root

130
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,470
of 15 over 4.

131
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,780
So this also gives us
two points to check.

132
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,930
The points are 1/4, 0, the
square root of 15 over 4.

133
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,520
And 1/4, 0, minus square
root of 15 over 4.

134
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,250
And finally, we
have our third case.

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,500
So our third case is
when lambda is equal to 2

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,300
and z is equal to 0.

137
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,810
So again, let's go back
over to our equation.

138
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,590
So when lambda equals 2
in the first equation,

139
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,690
we have 2x plus 1 equals 4x.

140
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,930
So 2x equals 1 or x is 1/2.

141
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,940
So this gives us
x equals a half.

142
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,530
And now if you take z
equals 0 and x equals 1/2,

143
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,810
we can take that down to
our constraint equation.

144
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,740
And we get a quarter
plus y squared equals 1,

145
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,820
so y is a square root of 3/4.

146
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,120
So y equals plus or minus
square root of 3 over 2.

147
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,820
And this gives us two points.

148
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:50,230
1/2, square root of 3 over 2, 0.

149
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,580
And 1/2, minus square
root of 3 over 2, 0.

150
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,980
Those were our three cases.

151
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,160
We've solved each of them.

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,740
We've solved each of
them all the way down

153
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,260
to finding the points
that they lead to.

154
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,010
Now remember, we said
already that there's

155
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,400
no boundary to this region.

156
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,670
It's just the sphere.

157
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,754
It has no edges.

158
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,670
So these are the only
points we have to check.

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,170
We have to check
these six points.

160
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,586
What do we have
to check them for?

161
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,600
Well, we have to look
at the value of f

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,560
at each of these six points.

163
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,220
And we want to figure
out where f is maximized

164
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,720
and where f is minimized,
and these six points are

165
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,600
the only points where
that could happen,

166
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,020
where f could be
maximized or minimized.

167
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,240
So we just have to evaluate
our objective function

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,220
f at these six points
and find the largest

169
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,430
value and the smallest value.

170
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,340
So let's do that.

171
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,180
So our objective
function, remember, it's

172
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,880
all the way back over here.

173
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,010
It's this function x
squared plus x plus 2 y

174
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,070
squared plus 3 z squared.

175
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,570
OK.

176
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,850
So let's look at the value of
that function at these point.

177
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,370
So x squared plus
x plus 2 y squared

178
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,710
plus 3 z squared at the point
1, 0, that's just equal to 2.

179
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,440
So I'm going to write the
function values just off

180
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,980
to the side of the points here.

181
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,700
So this gives me the value 2.

182
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,450
And I'm going to circle them.

183
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,730
So the point (1, 0, 0)
gives me the value 2.

184
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,420
The point minus 1, 0,
0-- so that's x squared

185
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,500
is 1, plus x is minus
1-- so that's 1 minus 1

186
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,750
is 0-- and then the y
and z terms are both 0.

187
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,230
So at the point minus 1, 0,
0, the function value is 0.

188
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,360
I'm going to circle that.

189
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,970
Oh boy.

190
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,075
OK, so at these points-- at
the point 1/4, 0, square root

191
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:43,145
of 15 over 4, and 1/4, 0, minus
square root of 15 over 4--

192
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm going to cheat and look
at what I wrote down already.

193
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,730
So you could do the
arithmetic yourself,

194
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,270
but I think it's not
that hard to work out

195
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,230
that in both of these cases, the
function value that you get out

196
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,510
is 25 over 8.

197
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm not going to do the
arithmetic right now.

198
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,830
But you can double-check
that for yourself.

199
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,870
And at these last two
points-- the points 1/2,

200
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,810
root 3 over 2, 0, and
1/2, minus root 3 over 2,

201
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,120
0-- the function has the same
value at both of those points.

202
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,500
That value is 9/4.

203
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, so 25 over 8 was the
value at both of these points,

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,740
and 9/4 is the value of
both of these points.

205
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,697
So now, to find the maximum
value of the function

206
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,280
and the minimum value
of the function,

207
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,850
we just look at the values
that we got and say,

208
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,225
which of these is biggest and
which of these is smallest?

209
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:42,487
And in our case, it's easy
to see that 0 is the minimum.

210
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:44,320
You know, all the other
values are positive,

211
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
so 0 is the minimum.

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:56,740
So our minimum value of f is
0 at the point minus 1, 0, 0.

213
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,480
And if you just compare the
values 2 and 25/8 and 9/4,

214
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,560
25/8 is the largest.

215
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,680
This is bigger than 3, whereas
both of those are less than 3,

216
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,280
for example.

217
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,654
This is one easy
way to see that.

218
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:18,100
So the max of f is
25/8, and that's

219
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,095
achieved at the points
1/4, 0, plus or minus

220
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:28,680
square root of 15 over 4.

221
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,820
So there you have it.

222
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,860
The method of
Lagrange multipliers.

223
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,220
We just followed exactly
the strategy that we have.

224
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,420
So you start out and you
have an objective function

225
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,770
and a constraint function.

226
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,710
And so what do you do?

227
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,610
You write down their
partial derivatives

228
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,780
and you come up with
this system of equations.

229
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,946
So this system of equations
that you get by setting,

230
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:54,100
you know, f_x equal to lambda
g_x, f_y equal to lambda g_y,

231
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,550
f_z equals lambda g_z, and
your constraint equation g

232
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,940
equals some constant.

233
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,100
So then the one part of this
procedure that isn't just

234
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,510
a recipe is that you need to
solve this system of equations,

235
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,110
but sometimes that can be hard.

236
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,782
So in this case, there were
a couple of observations

237
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:14,240
that we could make from the
second and third equations that

238
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,810
made it relatively
straightforward to do.

239
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,460
And that gave us some cases.

240
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,970
And then in each
of those cases, we

241
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,890
were able to completely solve
for the points x, y, and z.

242
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,760
Now we also could solve for the
associated values of lambda,

243
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,380
but lambda isn't
important to us.

244
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,690
It doesn't affect f.

245
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,330
We can forget about it
as soon as we found it,

246
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,320
once we found x, y, and z.

247
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,490
So we were able to solve.

248
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,982
In this case, we got
six points of interest.

249
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,440
And then you just
look at the value

250
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,470
of your objective
function at those points.

251
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,280
So that was what I wrote
down in these circles.

252
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,364
So you look at the value
of the objective function.

253
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:51,280
And to find the maximum
value of the function,

254
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,300
you just look at which
of those is largest.

255
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,895
Now sometimes-- not in this
problem, but in other problems,

256
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:59,200
you'll also have to check--
if the region has a boundary,

257
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,640
you'll also have to check for
possible maxima and minima

258
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,180
on the boundary of the region.

259
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,737
But a sphere doesn't
have any edges,

260
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,070
so it doesn't have any boundary.

261
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,020
So we don't have to
worry about that.

262
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,770
So that's how we apply the
method of Lagrange multipliers

263
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,690
to this problem.

264
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,370
And how you can apply it
to other problems as well.

265
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,763
I'll end there.
