JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.840
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.050
In lecture, you've been learning
about flux and

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.570
surface integrals in the
divergence theorem, and I have

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.720
a nice problem about
that for you here.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.620
So I've got this field F, and
it's a little bit ugly right?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.560
All right.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.970
So its coordinates are x to the
fourth y, minus 2x cubed y

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.890
squared, and z squared.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.750
And it's passing through the
surface of a solid that's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.670
bounded by the plane z equals
0, by the plane z equals h,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.412
and by the surface
x squared plus y

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:44.510
squared equals R squared.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.400
So often we call this
solid a cylinder.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.010
So it's got its bottom surface
in the plane z equals 0, and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.060
its top surface in the plane
z equals h, and it's got a

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.830
circular base with
radius R there.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.540
So what I'd like you to do is
to compute the flux of this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.040
field F through this cylinder.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.800
So I'll point out before I let
you at it, that to compute

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.230
this as a surface integral,
you could do it.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.980
You could do it.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.090
If you really want an exercise
in nasty arithmetic, I invite

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.090
you to do it.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.860
But you might be able to think
of a way to do this that

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.130
requires less effort than
parametrizing the three

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.420
surfaces and integrating
and so on.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.620
So I'll leave you with that.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.240
Why don't you pause the video,
work this one out, come back,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.490
and we can work on
it together.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.640
Hopefully, you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.570
Right before I left, I mentioned
that you were

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.060
computing a flux through a
surface here, but that doing

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.750
it as a surface integral is
maybe not the best way to go.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.500
And so, even without that hint,
probably many of you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.210
realized that really the way
that we want to go about this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.680
problem is with the divergence
theorem.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.190
OK.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.470
So in our case, the divergence
theorem--

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm just abbreviating
it div T-H-M here--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.840
says start with the double
integral over the surface of F

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.760
dot n d surface area.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.220
So S here is the surface
of this solid.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.780
So the divergence theorem says
that this surface integral,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.670
which is the flux that we're
interested in, is equal to the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.970
triple integral over the solid
region D-- so that's bounded

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.565
by the surface, and so that's
the solid cylinder here--

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.370
of div F dV. OK.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.200
So in our case, this is nice,
because in fact, this solid

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.120
region D is an easier to
understand, or easier to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.890
grapple with region than
the surface that we

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.680
started with, right?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.200
It's just one solid piece.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.910
It's easy to parametrize,
in fact.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.060
It's easy to describe especially
in cylindrical

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.630
coordinates, but also in
rectangular coordinates.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.820
Whereas this surface S, if we
wanted to talk about it, we'd

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.130
need to split it up into three
pieces, and we'd need to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.010
parametrize it.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.010
And it's kind of a hassle,
relatively speaking.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.510
Also, the divergence of this
field F is a lot simpler than

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.470
the field itself.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.240
If we go and look at this field,
all of its components

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.930
are polynomials.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.690
To compute its divergence,
we take

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.260
derivatives of all of them.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.950
And so that makes their degrees
lower, and then we

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.310
just add them.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.330
Life is a little bit simpler.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.990
So OK.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.140
So this process of using the
divergence theorem is going to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.690
make our lives easier.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.870
It's going to make this nasty
surface integral into an easy

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.860
to compute triple integral.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.580
So let's see actually
how it does.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.680
So let's compute div F first.
So we know what

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.930
the integrand is.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.490
All right.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.820
So we need to look at the
components of F, and so we

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.120
need to take the partial
of the first one

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.140
with respect to x.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.620
So that's x to the fourth
y with respect to x.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.240
So put that down over here.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.090
That's 4x cubed y.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.020
We just treat y as a constant.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.500
OK, so now we come back
and we need to look

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.390
at the second one.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.130
So it's minus 2x cubed
y squared.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.000
And it's the second one.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.260
We take its partial
with respect to y.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.780
So OK.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.300
So that's going to be minus
2x cubed times 2y.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.360
So that's going to be
minus 4x cubed y.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.320
And then we come back and we
look at the last component.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.670
And that's z squared.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.090
And so we need to take its
partial with respect to z.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.010
So in this case, that's
just 2z, and so we

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.000
add that on as well.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.110
Plus 2z.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.475
And in this case, not only are
these polynomials simpler than

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:03.980
the coordinates of F that we
had, but in fact, we've got

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.970
some simplification here.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.600
Life gets really,
really simple.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.720
So in fact, this is just going
to work out to 2z.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.600
So the divergence here is very
simple compared with the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.320
function F. More simple than we
have a right to expect, but

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.980
in any case, good.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.830
It's nice to work with.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.450
OK.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.700
So that's the divergence.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.320
So I'm going to write,
this is the flux.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.670
These integrals that we're
interested in.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.600
This surface integral, and
then by the divergence

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.250
theorem, it's the same as
this triple integral.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.130
So the divergence is this 2z.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.960
So the flux is what I get when
I just put that in here.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:53.990
So flux is equal to the triple
integral over our solid of 2z

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.810
dV. OK, so I've left some
stuff out of this.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.910
Because I'm going to start
writing down the bounds and

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.840
writing this down as an
iterated integral now.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.070
OK.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.140
So we have to choose some
coordinate system in which to

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.620
integrate over this solid.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.620
And so we have three kinds of
natural choices that we always

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.230
look back to.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.630
There are rectangular
coordinates and cylindrical

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.970
coordinates and spherical
coordinates.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.700
So spherical coordinates seem
pretty clearly inappropriate.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.220
Rectangular and cylindrical?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.470
You know, you could try and
do it in rectangular.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.890
It's not horrible.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.950
But this is a cylinder, right?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.760
I mean, it's crying out for
us to use cylindrical

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.910
coordinates.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.350
So let's use cylindrical
coordinates.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.700
So we're going to use
cylindrical coordinates.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.250
So to get dV we need a z, an r,
and a theta, but remember

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.800
there's this extra
factor of r.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.250
So it's going to be 2z times
r dz dr d theta.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.480
Right?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.950
This is dV. This r dz
dr d theta part.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.370
So that's what dV is when we use
cylindrical coordinates.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.840
OK, so now let's figure out
what the bounds are.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.710
So let's go look
at the cylinder

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.635
that we had over here.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.375
So it's bounded between z equals
0 at the bottom surface

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.610
and z equals h at
the top surface.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.270
OK.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.380
So that's easy enough.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.980
That's what the bounds
on z are.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.760
So let's put those in.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.380
So z is the innermost one, so
that's going from 0 to h.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.650
OK.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.790
How about the next one?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.000
So the next one is r.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.470
So let's go back over here.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:44.080
So r is the radius here after
we project it down.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.000
And we just get the circle
of radius big R

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.160
centered at the origin.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.110
So little r is going
from 0 to big R.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.220
And theta is the circle.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.950
It's the whole circle.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.690
So theta is going
from 0 to 2 pi.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.060
So cylinders are really easy
to describe what they look

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.610
like in cylindrical
coordinates.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.390
So let's put those in.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:07.450
So little r is going from
0 to big R, and theta is

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.990
going from 0 to 2 pi.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.260
OK.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.270
Wonderful.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.480
Now we just have to compute
this, right?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.930
We've got our flux is this
triple integral.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.850
So let's compute it.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.990
Let's walk over to this little
bit of empty board space.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.830
OK, so we have an iterated
integral.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.280
So let's do it.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.230
So the inner integral
is the integral from

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.770
0 to h of 2zr dz.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.750
Well, that's not that bad.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.690
That's equal to r
as a constant.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:50.520
So it's equal to rz squared
as z goes between 0 and h.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.950
It's dz, so z is going
from 0 to h.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:59.190
So plug in, and we just get
h squared r minus 0.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.860
So just h squared r.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.150
OK.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.740
So now let's do the
middle integral.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.320
So the middle integral is the
integral from 0 to big R d

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.550
little r of the inner
integral.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:21.090
So this is the integral from 0
to big R of the inner integral

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.260
which was h squared little
r d little r.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.930
OK.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.020
And that's not that
bad either.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.600
So h is just a constant.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.350
So this is equal to 1/2 h
squared r squared from r

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.960
equals 0 to big R. And
so that's 1/2 h

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.810
squared big R squared.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.230
That's the middle integral.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.230
So the outer one now.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.982
OK.

00:09:48.982 --> 00:09:50.290
So let's go back and look.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.050
So we're doing d theta as theta
goes from 0 to 2 pi of

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.340
whatever the middle
integral was.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:03.540
So it's the integral from 0 to
2 pi of whatever the value of

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.350
the middle integral was.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.110
So this is 1/2 h squared
big R squared d theta.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.670
And this is all just constant
with respect to theta.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:18.950
So that's going to be just
pi h squared r squared.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.150
You're just multiplying
it by 2 pi.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.470
All right.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.070
So pi h squared r squared.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.010
So this is our final answer.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.570
Let's just quickly recap
what we did.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.250
We had to compute the flux of
this field F through the

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:37.190
surface of a solid cylinder.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.260
And so we had options.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.520
We could do it directly by
trying to compute the surface

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.780
integrals, but in this case,
life was a lot easier if we

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.560
applied the divergence
theorem.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.120
So the divergence theorem
says that the flux--

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.170
which is equal to this
surface integral--

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.180
can also be written as the
triple integral over the solid

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.330
region bounded by the
surface of the

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.490
divergence of the field.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.050
All right.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.390
And so in our case, the
divergence was very nice and

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.160
simple, and the solid region
D was relatively simpler to

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.590
describe than-- its surface
that bounds it--

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.290
S. So this is why we think of
the divergence theorem.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.890
Because the divergence of the
field is easy to understand,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.210
and the solid is easier to
describe than its surface.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.360
So those are both things that
make us think to use the

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.090
divergence theorem for
a problem like this.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.580
So then by the divergence
theorem, the flux is just that

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.860
triple integral, and so we wrote
it out here that we were

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.340
integrating over a cylinder.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.530
So a natural thing to do is use
cylindrical coordinates.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.030
And then we computed the
triple integral just

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.340
like we always do.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.955
I did it in three steps: inner,
middle, and outer.

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:48.780
You don't have to do it
exactly this way if

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.280
you don't want to.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.010
But it works for me.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.450
OK.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.220
And we got our final answer:
pi h squared r squared.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.050
I'll stop there.
