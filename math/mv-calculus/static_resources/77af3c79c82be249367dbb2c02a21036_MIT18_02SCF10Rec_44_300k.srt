CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:12,460
In this video I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,010
What values of b will make this
vector field F a gradient

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,020
field where F is determined by e
to the x plus y times x plus

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,480
bi plus xj?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,030
So the e to the x plus
y is in both the i

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,640
component and the j component.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,820
And then once you've determined
what values b will

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,970
make that a gradient field--

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,800
for this b, or I should've
said these b's--

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,700
find a potential function
f using both

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,590
methods from the lecture.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,910
So why don't you pause the
video, work on this, and then

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,960
when you are ready to look
at how I do it bring

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,210
the video back up.

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:55,440

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,700
OK.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,680
Welcome back.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,410
So I'm going to start off
working on the first part of

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,920
this problem, which is to find
the values of b that will make

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,310
this vector field F
a gradient field.

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,170
And to clarify things for
myself, I'm going to write

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,370
down what M and what N are based
on F. So just to have it

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:23,110
clear, M is equal to e to the x
plus y times x plus b and N

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,170
is equal to x times
e to the x plus y.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,360
So those are our values
for M and N.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,070
And now if I want f to be a
gradient field, what I have to

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,670
do is I have to have M
sub y equal N sub x.

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,530
So I'm going to determine
M sub y and I'm going to

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,750
determine N sub x and I'm going
to compare them and see

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,130
what value of b I get.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,280
So M sub y, fairly
straightforward because this

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,390
is a constant in y.

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,380
And the derivative of this in
terms of y is just this back.

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,570
Right?

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,820
It's an exponential function
with the value that it has in

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,620
y is linear.

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,120
So you get exactly
that thing back.

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,450
So it actually is just either
the x plus y times x plus b.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,850
So the derivative of M
sub y is just itself.

41
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,220
The derivative of M
with respect to y.

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,510
Sorry.

43
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,140
Not the derivative of M sub y.

44
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,760
OK.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
That's an x.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,930
Let me just rewrite that.

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,940
OK, now N sub x is going
to have two parts.

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,720
N sub x, the derivative with
respect to x of this is 1.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,540
And so I have an e
to the x plus y.

50
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,120

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,750
And the derivative with respect
to the x of e to the x

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,310
plus y is just e
to the plus y.

53
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,300
For the same reason as the
derivative with respect to y

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
was the same.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,690
So then I'm just going to get
a plus x e to the x plus y.

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,440
So that means if I factor that
out, I get an e to the x plus

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,360
y times 1 plus x.

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,540
And we see that if F is going to
be a gradient field then b

59
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,700
has to equal 1.

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,930
Because it can only have
one value, and so b

61
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,830
has to equal 1.

62
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,840
To get N sub x to equal M
sub y, b has to equal 1.

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,050
So now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to erase that b, put

64
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,510
in a 1, so that the rest of my
calculations refer to that.

65
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,830
So now the second part said for
this b find a potential

66
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,530
function f using both methods
from the lecture.

67
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,370
So we're going to go through
both methods and hopefully we

68
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,220
get the same answer
both times.

69
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,890
So let me come back here.

70
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,220

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,830
The first method is where I'm
integrating along a curve from

72
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,460
(0, 0) to (x1, y1).

73
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,440
So I'm going to do it in
the following way.

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm going to let C1--

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,446
so here's (0, 0)--

76
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm going to let C1 be
the curve from (0,

77
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,110
0) up to (0, y1).

78
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,010
And then C2 be the curve--

79
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,240
so it's parameterized
in that direction--

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,600
C2 be the curve from (0,
y1) to (x1, y1).

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,460
OK?

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,580
So that's what I'm going to do
and I'm going to let C equal

83
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,190
the curve C1 plus C2.

84
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,160
So I'm going to have C
be the full curve.

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,770
And what I'm interested in doing
is finding f of (x1,

86
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:21,720
y1), which will just equal the
integral along C of f dot dr.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,670
So now we need to figure out
some important things

88
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,900
about C1 and C2.

89
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,620
What's happening on C1 and
what's happening on C2.

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,870
And the first thing I want to
point out-- actually, before I

91
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,690
do that, let me remind you that
this is going to be the

92
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,260
integral on C of
M dx plus N dy.

93
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,010
So this will be helpful
to refer back to.

94
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,830
That's really what we're
also doing here.

95
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,390
So on C1, what do I notice?

96
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:54,050
On C1, x is 0 and dx is 0.

97
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,690
And y goes between 0 and y1.

98
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,280

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,740
And then on C2, y
is equal to y1.

100
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,770
So dy is equal to 0 and x is
going between 0 and x1.

101
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,220
So those are the values that
are important to me.

102
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,950
So if you notice from this fact
and this fact, we see

103
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,550
that if we look at the integral
just along C1,

104
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,840
there's going to be
no M dx term.

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,190
And if we look at the integral
along C2, there's going to be

106
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,580
no dy term because of that.

107
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,690
So let me write down the terms
that do exist, and we'll see

108
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,170
some other things
drop out also.

109
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,990

110
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,510
If I look along first just C1,
I'm only going to get--

111
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,980
I said the dy term, which--

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,470
let me just make
sure-- dx is 0.

113
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,890
I'm only going to get the
dy term, which is--

114
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,100
well, x is 0 there.

115
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,310
So I'm going to get 0 times
e to the 0 plus y.

116
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,270
dy.

117
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,930
From 0 to y1.

118
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,110
Well that's nice and easy to
calculate, thank goodness.

119
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,620
That's just 0.

120
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,440
So all I have to do for this
one is just leave it at 0.

121
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,690
That's everything that
happens along C1.

122
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,220
That's what I'm interested in.

123
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,840
I just get 0 there.

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,940
And if I integrate along C2,
as I mentioned, dy is 0.

125
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,490
So we don't have any component
with N dy.

126
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,530
We just have the component M
dx that we're integrating.

127
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,805
OK, so if I integrate along C2,
I just have M dx and M is

128
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,610
e to the x plus y
times x plus 1.

129
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,660
And y is fixed at y1.

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,620
So it's e to the x plus
y1 times x plus 1 dx.

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,540
And I'm going from 0 to x1.

132
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,210
I'm going to make sure I didn't
make any mistakes.

133
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,130
I'm going to check
my work here.

134
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,520
Yes, I'm looking good.

135
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,020
OK.

136
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,550
So this one is 0.

137
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,800
So all I have to do is find
an antiderivative of this.

138
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,830
And the term-- if I multiply
through, I see that here I get

139
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,610
exactly the same thing when I
look for an antiderivative.

140
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,960
And here I get, I believe, two
terms when I look for an

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,420
antiderivative.

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,180
But I'm going to get
some cancellation.

143
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,600
And ultimately, when I'm all
done I'm going to get this.

144
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,660
xe to the x plus y1 evaluated
at 0 and x1.

145
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,050
You could do this.

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,900
This is really now a single
variable problem.

147
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,210
So I'm not going to work out all
the details, but you might

148
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,930
want to do an integration by
parts on that first part of

149
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,740
it, if that helps.

150
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,260
Or an integration by parts
on the whole thing.

151
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,820
That would also do the trick.

152
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,790
So what do I get here?

153
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,800
Then I get x1 e to
the x1 plus y1.

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
And then when I put in 0 for x
here, I get 0, so that's it.

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,430
So this, plus possibly a
constant, is equal to my f.

156
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,280
So I see that in general I get
f of xy is equal to xe to the

157
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,080
x plus y plus a constant.

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,060
So that's what I get in
the first method.

159
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,594
So now let's use the
second method.

160
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,770
So I should say f of (x1, y1).

161
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,900
In the second method, what
I do is M, remember, is

162
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,550
equal to f sub x.

163
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,890

164
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:23,020
So f sub x is equal to M which
is equal to e to the x plus y

165
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,350
times x plus 1.

166
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,440
So if I want to find
an antiderivative--

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,230
if I want to find f, I should
take an antiderivative, right?

168
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,930
With respect to x.

169
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,820
And so notice I already
did that, actually.

170
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,450
If I just put this as y, I
already did that here.

171
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,851
And so I should get something
that looks like this.

172
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:46,490
xe to the x plus y plus possibly
a function that only

173
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,880
depends on y.

174
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,400
And the reason is when I take a
derivative with respect to x

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
of this, obviously
this would be 0.

176
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,680
So it doesn't show
up over here.

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,850
So this, we make sure that--

178
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,660
oh, that I shouldn't
write equals.

179
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,610
Sorry.

180
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,260
That I shouldn't write equals.

181
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,110
OK?

182
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,030
This would imply that
this is equal to f.

183
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,310
Sorry about that.

184
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,790
f sub x was equal to M
was equal to this.

185
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,560
That implies--

186
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,530
when I take an antiderivative
of an x--

187
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,520
that xe to the x plus y plus
g of y is equal to f.

188
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,670
So I apologize.

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,740
That wouldn't have been an
equals because obviously those

190
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,860
two things are not equal.

191
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,720
That would imply, I think--

192
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,130
yeah, that would imply
something very bad

193
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,530
mathematically.

194
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,330
So make sure you understand I
put an equals sign where I

195
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,600
should not have. This is
actually a derivative of that.

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,790
So this is antiderivative
of this.

197
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,690
So now I have a candidate
for f.

198
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,680
And so now I'm going to take
the derivative of that.

199
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,700
And what's the derivative of
that with respect to y?

200
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,920
So f sub y based on this is
going to be equal to xe to the

201
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,650
x plus y plus g prime of y.

202
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,060
So the prime here indicates
it's in a derivative in y.

203
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,470
And now that f sub y should also
equal N. And N equals xe

204
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,820
to the x plus y.

205
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,270
So what do I get here?

206
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,930
I see xe to the x plus y has
to equal xe to the x plus y

207
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,050
plus g prime of y.

208
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,300
Which means g prime of
y is equal to 0.

209
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,460
Which means when I take an
antiderivative of that I just

210
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,710
get a constant.

211
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,620

212
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,590
That means g of y
was a constant.

213
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:37,390
So that implies that this boxed
expression right here is

214
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,350
f of xy if g of y is
just a constant.

215
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,640
So let me go through that
logic one more time.

216
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,190
I had f sub x.

217
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,360
I took an antiderivative to
get f but it involved a

218
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,960
constant in x that was
a function of y.

219
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,650
I take a derivative
of that in y.

220
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,890
I compare that to what I know
the derivative is in y.

221
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,770
That gives me that this is 0.

222
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,090
So its antiderivative, which is
g of y, is just a constant.

223
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,420
And so all together this implies
that f of xy is equal

224
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,970
to xe to the x plus
y plus a constant.

225
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,060
Which is exactly what
I got before.

226
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,410
Fortunately, I got two answers
that are the same.

227
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,700
So that's it.

228
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,550
I'll stop there.
