CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.350
In this video I would like us
to use Green's theorem to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.060
compute the following integral
where it's the integral over

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.140
the curve c, where c is
the circle drawn here.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.020
So the circle is oriented so
the interior is on the left

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.320
and it's centered at the point
where x equals a, y equals 0.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.680
So the integral--

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220
you can read it but I will read
it also for you-- it's

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.800
the integral of 3x squared y
squared dx plus 2x squared

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.350
times the quantity
1 plus xy dy.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.730
So you are supposed
to use Green's

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.180
theorem to compute that.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.830
And why don't you pause the
video, give it a shot, and

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.940
then when you're ready to see my
solution you can bring the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.190
video back up.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040
OK, welcome back.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.140
Well, what we're going to do,
obviously to use Green's

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.150
theorem to compute this--
because I gave you a big hint

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.160
that you're supposed to use
Green's theorem because we

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.990
have an integral over
a closed curve.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.940
And what we're going to do is
now take the integral of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.850
another certain integrand--

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.800
obviously related in
some way to this--

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
over the region that
I will shade here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.400
So we're interested in this
shaded region now.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.260
So let me write down what
Green's theorem is and then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.450
we'll put in the important
parts.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.050
OK, so just to remind you, I'm
not going to write down all

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.770
the hypotheses of Green's
theorem that we need, but the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.500
point that I want to make is
that if we start the integral

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.980
over this closed curve c of
mdx plus ndy we can also

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.770
integrate over the region that
C encloses of N sub x minus M

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.660
sub y dy dx.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
So that is ultimately what
we're going to do.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.500
And so in this case again, as
always, m is going to be the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.470
function associated with
the dx portion.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.270
It's the ice component
of the vector field.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.830
And n is going to be the
function associated

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.880
here with the dy.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.830
That's standard obviously.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.390
So now what we want to do is
transform what we have there

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.500
into something that
looks like this.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.600
So the region--

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.030
I'm just going to keep calling
it R for the moment--

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.850
but the region R you'll notice
is the thing that I shaded in

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.790
the drawing.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.930
And so now let's compute
what this is--

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110
well you have the capacity
to do that.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.090
That's just some straight
taking derivative.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.620
So I'm just going to write down
what it is and not show

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.760
you all the individual pieces.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.100
So I'll just write down what
you get and then the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.060
simplified version.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.120
So you get 6x squared y
plus 4x is N sub x.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.080
And then M sub y is negative
6x squared y.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.160
And I'm going to call dy dx, I'm
just going to refer to it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.510
now as dA, because that makes
it a lot easier to write.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.210
Oh, I guess I should
call this--

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.735
well, dA, this is the area.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.460
The volume form there.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.650
So this simplifies and I just
get the integral of 4x over

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.590
this region dA.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.660
Now this-- you saw an example
of this in lecture of how to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.110
deal with these types of
problems. At this point, if I

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.630
really wanted to I could figure
out what the bounds are

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.000
in that region in terms of x and
y, and I could do a lot of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.020
work and integrate it
all, or I could

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.380
remember one simple fact.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.450
Which is that if I have--

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.140
I think you see it in class as
x bar-- the center of mass

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.720
should be equal to 1 over the
volume of the region times the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.100
integral of x dA over
the region.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.720
That's what we know.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.350
This should be-- this maybe
doesn't look like a v. But so

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.330
in this case volume
is area, isn't it?

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.720
Maybe I should write area, that
might make you nervous.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.330
So if I take the area--

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.310
I could just say A of R-- if
I take the area, 1 over the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.200
area, and then I multiply by the
integral of x over R with

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.040
dy dx with respect to dA, then
I get the center of mass.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.400
Well, let's look at what in
this picture-- what is the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.380
center of mass here?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.950
If I want to balance this thing
on a pencil tip, if I

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.390
want to balance this disc--
assuming the density is

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.110
everywhere the same on a pencil
tip-- where am I going

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.660
to put the pencil?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.520
I'm going to put it right
at the center.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.330
The x value there is a, the
y value there is 0.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.970
So if I had the y center of
mass, I would want 0.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.750
But I want the x center
of mass, so I want a.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.110
This x bar is actually
equal to, from the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.720
picture, is equal to a.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.380
And now let's notice
what I've done.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.060
I have taken--

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.290
I had this quantity here--

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.780
I've taken this quantity except
for the 4 and I have a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.850
way of writing explicitly what
this quantity is without

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.240
actually doing any of
the integration.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.300
I haven't done any sophisticated
things at this

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.030
point except know what the
center of mass is.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.310
So also what is the area
of the region?

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.320
I'm going to need that.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.730
The area of the region-- it's
a circle of radius a.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.840
So the area is pi a squared.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.810
So this quantity is
pi a squared.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.870
And all this together tells me
that the integral of x over R

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.690
dA, if I solve for this part,
I get a times pi a squared.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.650
So I get pi a cubed.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.000
And that only differs from
our answer by one thing.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.750
There's a scalar--

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.270
you multiply by 4 and that
gives us what we want.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.350
I said differs from
our answer.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.510
Differs from what we
want by one thing.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.710
We just multiplied by 4 there,
so we multiply by 4 here.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.720
So in fact--

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.680
maybe there looks like there
was a little magic here, so

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.740
let me point out some of the
key points at the end.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.450
I started off knowing I was
trying to integrate 4x over

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.710
the region R. And R in this case
was a circle centered at

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.520
(a, 0) and of radius a.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.640
And then I said, well,
I don't want to do a

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.460
lot of work for this.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.170
So I'm going to not cheat, but
I'm going to use my knowledge

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.940
of the center of mass
to make this easier.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.420
So the center of mass is equal
to 1 divided by the area of

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.140
the region times the integral
of x over the region.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.190
So I want to find the integral
of x over the region, I just

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.550
solve for the integral
of x over the region.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.450
I just solve for that part.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.220
The center of mass-- from just
looking at the picture and

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.920
understanding what the center of
mass means-- the center of

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.480
mass in the x component is a.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.100
The area is pi a squared.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.740
So I end up with a pi a
cubed when I solve for

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.860
the integral of x.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.260
And then because I wanted the
integral of 4x, I just

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.930
multiply by 4.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.000
And so the final answer is
actually 4 pi a cubed.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.790
So what I was trying to find,
if you remember, was I was

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.710
trying to find the value when
I integrated over this curve

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.980
of a certain vector field.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.710
And that one was going
to be a little messy

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.750
to do it that way.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.270
But Green's theorem, actually
there's a lot of cancellation

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.370
which makes it much easier, and
then the center of mass is

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.580
a nice little trick
to use at the end.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.070
And then the calculation
is quite simple.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.430
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
