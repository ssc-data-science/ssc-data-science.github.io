JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,120
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,250
In lecture you've been learning
about surface

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,760
integrals, flux, and the
divergence theorem.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,390
And I have a nice problem here
that'll put your knowledge of

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,740
those things to the test. So
in this situation, I have a

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,480
hemisphere.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,190
So this is a hemisphere.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,330
It's the right half of a sphere,
so the part where y is

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,420
positive, or non-negative,
I guess.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,950
So just the surface of that
hemisphere, and it has radius

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,920
R and it's centered
at the origin.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,550
So I have this hemisphere and
I have the field F, which is

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,200
given by y times j hat.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,835
So it's just always in
the y-direction.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,360

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,670
So I have this field and I have
this hemisphere, and what

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,320
I'd like to do is I'd like you
to compute the flux of the

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,630
field through this hemisphere.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,000
But as a hint, rather than
doing it by computing the

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,410
surface integral by
parameterizing, what I'd like

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,580
you to do is to use the
divergence theorem to make

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,340
your life a little bit easier.

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,020
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,240
that out, come back and we
can work on it together.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,920

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,960
Hopefully, you had some luck
working on this problem.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's see how we can
go about it.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,470
So the thing that we're
asked to compute--

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,020
let's give this a name, just
so we can refer to it.

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,960
So let's call this surface of
the sphere S. All right.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,500
So we want the flux through S.
And so the flux through S is

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,740
the double integral over S of
our field F dotted with the

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,840
normal with respect to surface
area, so with respect to

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,820
surface area.

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,260
So I guess this was a kind of
bad choice, this S. We've got

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,300
S that means--

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,170
this S means the sphere, this
S just means surface area.

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,800
OK.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,700
Hopefully, you can keep
those two sorted.

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,530
This is the thing
that we want.

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,910
And we'd like to compute it.

43
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,330
Rather than by parameterizing
this hemisphere, we'd like to

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,640
compute it by using the
divergence theorem.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,500
So the divergence theorem
relates the integral over a

46
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,140
surface to a triple integral
over a region.

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,290
So what we'd like to find is a
solid region for which this is

48
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,360
all or part of the boundary.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,430
Now this half hemisphere--

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,630
rather, half-sphere,
this hemisphere--

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,710
doesn't actually enclose a
region, but there's an obvious

52
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,180
region that's closely related
to it, which would be the

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,760
solid sphere.

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,240
If you just filled in that
half-sphere there.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,270
So then, for that
solid sphere--

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,990
so the right half of the solid
sphere, with radius R,

57
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,300
centered at the origin,
that hemisphere--

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,840
that solid hemisphere, has a
surface that consists of S,

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,100
and it also consists of a disc
centered at the origin.

60
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,160
So it consists of--

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,650
I'm going to draw it in right
here-- it's this disc.

62
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,030
This one.

63
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,840

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,320
That disc right there, together
with our hemisphere

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,850
that interests us, make up the
boundary of this solid

66
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,880
hemisphere.

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,710
So I'm going to call
that disc--

68
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm going to give it a name--

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm going to call it S2.

70
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,510

71
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,350
So we want this integral and
we're going to use the

72
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,140
divergence theorem.

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,610
So the way we're going to use
the divergence theorem is

74
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,210
we're going to use the
divergence theorem to relate

75
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,490
this double integral
over a surface

76
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,130
to that triple integral.

77
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,290
But I'm going to have to get S2
involved because I need--

78
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,710
for the divergence theorem
to apply--

79
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,550
I need surfaces which
completely

80
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,760
bound a solid region.

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,980
So what we know by the
divergence theorem is that the

82
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:12,370
double integral over both S
and S2 of F dot n hat with

83
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,940
respect to surface area is equal
to the triple integral--

84
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,020
OK, so I guess I need
another letter here.

85
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,260
So I'm going to call this
D for that whole

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,620
half-hemisphere, the
solid hemisphere.

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,980
So D, this is the solid
hemisphere.

88
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:36,430

89
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,670
So this D is the solid
hemisphere

90
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,800
that they bound of--

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,850
OK, so it's the triple integral
over D of the

92
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,450
divergence of F with
respect to volume.

93
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,900
So this is what the divergence
theorem tells us and now we--

94
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,670
so OK.

95
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,570
So good.

96
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,810
So now what's going to be nice
is that in this case this

97
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,080
triple integral is going to
be very easy to compute.

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,900
And the surface integral
over S2 is going

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,980
to be easy to compute.

100
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,800
And so what we're going to be
left with after we compute

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,970
those two things, we'll be able
to subtract and get just

102
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,210
the surface integral over S.
So lets think about doing

103
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,080
those things.

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,690
So first let's do the surface
integral over S2.

105
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,135

106
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:33,705
The surface integral over S2
of F dot n with respect to

107
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,590
surface area.

108
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,150
Well, what is F on
that disc S2?

109
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,970
So let's go look at
our picture again.

110
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,530
So this disc is the disc of
radius R centered at the

111
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,025
origin in the x, z plane.

112
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,700
So it's in the x, z plane.

113
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,310
So that means it's in the
plane y equals 0.

114
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,750
So F on that disc is just 0.

115
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,840
It's the 0 field.

116
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,670
It's 0 everywhere
on that disc.

117
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,400
And if you take a surface
integral of a 0 field dot the

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,130
normal vector, well, 0 dot
the normal is just 0.

119
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,540
So if we come back over
here, this integrand

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,820
is 0 dot the normal.

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,210
So it's always 0.

122
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,520
So we're integrating 0.

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,100
So we just get 0.

124
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,730
Definite integral of 0 is 0.

125
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,190
Double integral of 0 is 0.

126
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,120
Great.

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,420
So this S2, the surface integral
of F is really easy

128
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,760
to compute.

129
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,430
That's the first
one we needed.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,505
Now we need the triple
integral.

131
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:42,570
So let's compute the triple
integral over the solid

132
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:52,140
hemisphere of div F dV.
Well, what is div F?

133
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,470
Well, you know, so div F is just
the sum of the partial

134
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,440
derivatives of the
three components.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,910
So in our case if we go back and
look, well, F is 0 i hat

136
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,660
plus y j hat plus 0 k hat.

137
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,740
So when you take the partial
derivatives you get 0 plus the

138
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,670
partial derivative of y with
respect to y is just 1, plus

139
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,910
from the third component
we also get 0.

140
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,880
So the divergence--

141
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,970
let's go back over here-- the
divergence is just 1.

142
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,780
It's just a constant 1.

143
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,830
That's great.

144
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,000
So this triple integral
is equal to--

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,270
I'm going to bring
it down here--

146
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,680
so it's equal to the triple
integral over D of 1 dV. But,

147
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,690
of course, when you integrate 1
over a solid region what you

148
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,220
get is just the volume
of that region.

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,700
So whatever this number is
it's the volume of that

150
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,560
hemisphere.

151
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,100
Well, OK, so what's the
volume of a sphere?

152
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,195
It's 4/3 pi r cubed.

153
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,890
So the volume of a hemisphere
is half of that.

154
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,270
So that's 2 pi R cubed
divided by 3.

155
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,680

156
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,130
So that's the triple integral
of the divergence over the

157
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,260
solid region.

158
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,640
So what does that mean?

159
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,910
So our integral, the integral
over S of F dot n with respect

160
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:25,330
to surface area is equal to this
triple integral over D of

161
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:34,460
div F dV minus the double
integral over S2 of F dot n d

162
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,590
surface area.

163
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,030
And so we just saw that this
is equal to 2 pi R cubed

164
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,150
over 3 minus 0.

165
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,610
But 0 is 0.

166
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,570
So it's just 2 pi
R cubed over 3.

167
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,200
So let's quickly recap.

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,370
To start off with, we just
had this hemisphere.

169
00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,390
And we're asked to compute a
surface integral over this

170
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:06,100
hemisphere of a flux of this
field F. So rather than going

171
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,100
ahead and calculating it
directly, what we realized is

172
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,850
that by the divergence theorem
we could consider this to be a

173
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,010
difference of a triple integral
minus another surface

174
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,000
integral such that those two
surfaces together bounded the

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
region that you were triple
integrating over.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,820
So in principle there were many
possible regions that we

177
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,520
could have chosen.

178
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,630
Many possible solid regions that
we could have chosen to

179
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,210
do that triple integral over and
to use the other half of

180
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,990
its boundary.

181
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,250
But there's one particularly
nice one, which is just the

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,710
solid hemisphere of which this
hemisphere s was the boundary,

183
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,140
or part of the boundary.

184
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,210
And so then that gave us
this other part of its

185
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,240
boundary was this disc.

186
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:58,340
So we introduced this new solid
region, D, and the rest

187
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,390
of its boundary, which was this
other surface, this disc.

188
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,130
S2.

189
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,120
And so then, by the divergence
theorem, rather than computing

190
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,830
the integral over our original
region S we could just compute

191
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,170
the triple integral over the
solid region and the surface

192
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,170
integral over the other
half of the boundary.

193
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,000
So sometimes that won't
be helpful.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,930
Sometimes you'll have an ugly
field, you'll have an ugly

195
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,530
region, things won't work out.

196
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,580
But in this case, it worked
out really nicely.

197
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,270
The triple integral was easy
to compute, as we saw over

198
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,250
here, because the divergence
was constant.

199
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,360
Because the divergence was just
equal to 1, the triple

200
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,480
integral just gave the volume.

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,200
And the other surface integral
was also easy to compute

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,010
because F dot n on that surface
was equal to 0.

203
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,940
So integrating it
was very easy.

204
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,650
We just were integrating
0 and we got 0.

205
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,740
So in this case, these choices
worked out very, very nicely.

206
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,330
They made our life
nice and simple.

207
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,850
And so in the end, all we had
to do were these two almost

208
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,860
trivial integrals.

209
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,813
They didn't really require
any computation

210
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,990
at all on our part.

211
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,790
And then a little bit of
subtraction, except we were

212
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,870
subtracting 0 so even the
subtraction was easy.

213
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,690
So that was what we did, worked
out very nicely, 2 pi R

214
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,150
cubed over 3 was our answer.

215
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,990
And I'll end there.

216
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,210
