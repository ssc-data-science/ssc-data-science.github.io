CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.100
In this video, I'd like us to do
the following two problems,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.660
both related to the same
position vector.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.690
So we're starting off with a
position vector defined as r

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.720
of t is equal to 1 minus 2t
squared i plus t squared j

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.870
plus negative 2 plus
2t squared k.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.350
So that's our position vector,
and I'd like us to do the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.760
following two things.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.740
And you'll notice this problem
is pretty much just a

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.830
computational problem.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.290
We're going to make sure that we
know what these things I'm

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.140
about to talk about are, how you
define them, and how you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.830
get from the position vector
to each of these things.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.260
So we want to compute the
velocity, the speed, the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590
acceleration, and find
the unit tangent

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250
vector for r of t.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.860
And then, the second part, we
want to compute the arc length

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.330
of the trajectory from t
equals 0 to t equals 2.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.030
So I'll give you a moment
to do that problem.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.070
Why don't you pause the video,
work on the problem.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.430
When you're ready to check your
work, bring the video

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.860
back up and I'll show
you how I do it.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.120
OK, welcome back.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.700
Well, hopefully, you felt
comfortable with answering

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.850
these questions.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330
So now I will answer them
and you can compare your

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.200
answers with mine.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.180
So let me start off
with part a.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.840
Part a, the first thing
we're going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.850
do is find the velocity.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.050
So velocity is really-- all
we need to do is take the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.640
derivative of the position
vector with respect to t.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.260
So I'm just going to
take r prime of t.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.880
And now I'm going to write it in
the shorthand notation that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.950
you've seen with the brackets
to denote that it's not a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.750
point, but it's a vector.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.250
So this is what you've seen
to denote a vector

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.380
rather than a point.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160
So the derivative with respect
to t of the first component is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.100
just negative 4t.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.760
The derivative with respect to
t of the second component is

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.520
just 2t, because we had t
squared, so when we take its

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.450
derivative, we just get 2t.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.490
And the third component was
negative two plus 2t squared,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.020
so when I take its derivative,
I get a 4t, so that is

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.180
actually v of t, OK?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.710
And then the next thing I asked
you to do is determine

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.710
the speed, and the speed, of
course, is just the length of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.540
the velocity vector, right?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.540
So we just need to find the
length of v. Now, to do that,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.770
to remind ourselves what we do
for that, we actually take the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.110
inner product of v with itself,
the dot product of v

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.900
with itself, and then we take
the square root of that.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.070
So let's look at what the
dot product will be.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.040
Let me find the squared thing
first, and then I will take

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.830
the square root.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.270
So v dotted with v, the first
component I'm going to have

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.840
negative 4t quantity
squared, so that's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.760
going to be 16t squared.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.540
And then the second component
is going to be 2t quantity

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.830
squared, so I'm going to
have plus 4t squared.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.920
And the third component is going
to be another-- it's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.130
going to be 4t quantity
squared, so I

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.720
get another 16t squared.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.980
So when I add those up, I
believe I get 36t squared?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.230
Yes, good.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920
And so then, I just have to take
the square root of both

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.050
sides to get what the speed
actually is instead of the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.300
square of the speed.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.090
So I get 6t, OK?

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.080
So that's the velocity;
that's the speed.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.280
Now I need to find the
acceleration and I need to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.100
find the unit tangent vector.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.250
OK, so let me see.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.040
I will come over here.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.190
Let me step off here and I will
find the acceleration and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.200
the unit tangent vector.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.950
So the acceleration, if you
remember, the acceleration is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.440
actually just the derivative
of the velocity

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.380
with respect to t.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.020
So the acceleration is going
to be the derivative of

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.250
negative 4t is just
negative 4.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.470
The derivative of 2t is just 2,
and the derivative of 4t is

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.660
just 4, all with respect to t.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.750
OK.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.420
So the acceleration vector is
equal to negative 4 comma 2

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.620
comma 4, so you see this
actually has constant

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.040
acceleration.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.040
So at any point, your
acceleration is always this

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.220
value, so it's not surprising
that our velocity is

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.280
increasing, and actually, it's
increasing-- you'll notice,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.230
each of these components
is constant.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.140
The velocity, each of the
components is linear, and if

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.490
we went back, we look at the
position vector, each of those

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.950
components is quadratic.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.200
And this is exactly what you
expect from just your

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.810
understanding of derivatives in
single-variable calculus.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.120
If you start off with a constant
and you find an

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.970
antiderivative, it's going to
be linear, and you find

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.710
another antiderivative, you're
going to have a quadratic, so

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.680
we shouldn't be surprised
by any of that.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.650
Now we have one more thing to do
with Part a, and that is to

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.770
find the unit tangent vector.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.320
And that's fairly easy, because
all we have to do is,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.770
if you notice, we have the
velocity vector and we have

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.940
its length.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.770
And so to find the unit tangent
vector, all we have to

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.900
do is take the velocity and
divide it by its length, and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.110
that will normalize it.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.140
That means that its length will
be one at that point,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.370
because you're taking a vector,
dividing by its

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.810
length, so the length of the
new vector will have to be

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.760
length one.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.670
So let me write that down.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.235
And actually, I guess the point
to remember here is that

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:44.180
the velocity vector is tangent
to the path you're carving

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.430
out, to the trajectory.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.440
OK, so this is a vector.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.220
This is a scalar.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.220
So I'm going to take 1 over 6t,
and I'm going to multiply

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:08.310
it by negative 4t, 2t, 4t, and
this gives me, when I do my

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.110
division, looks like it gives
me a negative 2/3,-- right--

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.490
1/3, 2/3.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.370
So that is the unit tangent
vector, OK?

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.500
OK, and now, we have one more
point we want to make, and

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.490
that is having to do with the
arc length of the trajectory.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.400
That was the second part of this
problem, was to find the

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.320
arc length of the trajectory
from t equals 0 to t equals 2.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.770
So let me just draw
another line here.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.735
And what we want to do there
then is-- really what we want

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:56.610
to do is we want to integrate
the speed, right?

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.040
We want to integrate the
speed from 0 to 2.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.580
So this--

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.860
let me come over here--

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.520
this absolute v, you might have
also seen it written as

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.060
ds dt, right?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.060
And so we want to integrate
this in dt--

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.220
in t-- sorry-- from 0 to 2.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.180
And so we come over here.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.200
We want to integrate
from 0 to 2, 6t dt.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.140
That's fairly easy.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.890
That's going to be 6t squared
over 2, evaluated from 0 to 2.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.660
And so when I write that down,
I'm going to get 6 times 4

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.840
divided by 2, 24, divided by
2, I just get 12, and the

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.020
other term is 0.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.950
So the arc length is--

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.310
of the trajectory from 0
to 2 is just 12 units.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.760
So this really was a purely
computational type of problem.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.510
All we were doing, if you come
back over here and you recall

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.520
what we were trying to
do, is we started off

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.050
with a position vector.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.310
We just did a lot
of computation.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.730
We found the velocity, the
speed, the acceleration, the

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.940
unit tangent vector, and then we
just wanted to find the arc

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.840
length of the trajectory.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.540
So this is all very
computational, but just to

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.730
make sure we understood what
all the terms meant and how

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.190
they were related
to one another.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.950
So I'll stop there.
