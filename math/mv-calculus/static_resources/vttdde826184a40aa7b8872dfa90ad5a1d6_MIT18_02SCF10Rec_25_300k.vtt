DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.910
Today the problem I'd like
to work with you is about

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.930
computing partial derivatives
and the total differential.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.760
So we have a function z which
is x squared plus y squared.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.100
So it depends on the two
variables x and y.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.920
Now the variables x and y
themselves depend on two

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.210
auxiliary variables, u and v.
So that's the setup that we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.520
have.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.500
So in part a, we just want to
compute the total differential

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.420
dz in terms of dx and dy.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.220
So u and v aren't going to
enter into the picture.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.220
And then in part b, we're going
to compute the partial

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.270
derivative partial z partial
u in two different ways.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
First, we're going to compute
it using the chain rule.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.540
And then we're going to
compute it using total

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.940
differentials.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.750
And so we'll substitute in some
of the work that we had

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.610
in a to solve that part.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.630
So why don't you pause
the video now

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.790
and work on the problem.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.440
We'll check back and we'll
do it together.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.480
Hi, and welcome back.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.730
Let's get started.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.130
So first, computing
a is not so bad.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.670
So we just need to first
remember, what does it mean to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.980
compute the total
differential?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.380
So the total differential dz is
just the partial derivative

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.670
of z in the x-direction dx plus
z in the y-direction dy.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.430
OK?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.250
So now, looking at our
formula here for z.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.315
We have, so, the partial
derivative of z in the

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:58.020
x-direction is 2x,
so this is 2x dx.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.466
And the partial derivative
of z in the y is 2y,

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:05.860
so we have 2y dy.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.310
OK, and that's all we
have to do for a.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.650
Now for b, we want to compute
this partial derivative in two

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.510
different ways.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.780
First, using the chain rule.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.910
So let's remember what
the chain rule says.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.000
So whenever I think about the
chain rule, I like to draw

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.830
this dependency graph.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.165
OK?

00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.950
And this is just a way for me to
organize how the different

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.150
variables depend
on one another.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.270
So at the top, we have z.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.200
And z is a function of x and y,
but x is itself a function

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.330
of both u and v, and y is also
a function of u and v. So z

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.060
depends on x and y, and x and y
each jointly depend on u and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.850
v. So it's a little bit
complicated, the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.540
relationships here.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.260
So now, what the chain rule
says is that if we take a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.510
partial derivative--

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.880
partial z partial u--

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.250
we have to go through our
dependency graph.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.960
Every way that we can get from
z to u, we get a term in our

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.980
summation for each
one of those.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.240
So for instance, z goes
to x goes to u.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.000
So that means that we have
partial z, partial x, partial

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.130
x, partial u.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.470
And then we can also go
z goes to y goes to u.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.780
And that will give us partial
z, partial y,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.000
partial y, partial u.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.930
And now these partials are ones
that we can just compute

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.590
from our formulas.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.490
So for instance, partial
z partial x is

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.820
2x, which we computed.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.270
Now partial x, partial u, we
have to remember that x is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.770
defined as u squared
minus v squared.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.570
And so partial x, partial
u, that's 2u.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.280
Partial z, partial y, again, is
this 2y that we computed.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.360
And partial y, partial u is v.
This v is just because u was

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.060
uv, and we take a partial
in the u-direction.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.310
OK.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:49.310
So altogether this is 4ux plus
2vy, and that's our partial

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.410
derivative.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.900
So notice that, you know, x is a
function of u and v. So if I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.950
really wanted to, I could
substitute for x its formula

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.191
for u and v, but that's
not really necessary.

00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:06.400
You know, Wwat's interesting
about these problems is how

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.490
the differentials depend on one
another, and I'm perfectly

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.870
happy with an answer that has
mixed variables like this.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.070
That's fine.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.900
So now, let's go over here and
let's see if we can get the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.910
same answer by using total
differentials.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.340
Now, I have to say that the
chain rule that we used on the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.600
previous problem, it's the
quickest way to do

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.620
these sorts of things.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.420
I like to do total differentials
if I have some

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.130
time to actually explore
the problem and get

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.750
comfortable with it.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.190
I prefer to use total
differentials because I think

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.090
it's a little bit clearer.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.920
Somehow, this chain rule it's
just, to me, it's just a

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.090
prescription, it's not
an explanation.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.325
So why don't we compute some
total differentials.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.060
So we already saw-- let me
just repeat over here.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.630
We already saw that dz
is 2x dx plus 2y dy.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.600
OK.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.430
Now, we want to use the fact
that x is itself a function of

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.700
u and v. So that's what
we need to do now.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:30.890
So that tells us that
dx is 2u du minus 2v

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.660
dv in the same way.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.630
And dy.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:43.640
So remember, y was uv. So taking
d of uv, we get v du

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.420
plus u dv. OK?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.700
So now, so what we've done is
we've just listed out all of

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.870
the total differentials.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.210
And the nice thing about this
is once you've done these

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.860
computations, now it's
just substitution.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.160
So what we really want to know
is how does z depend on u and

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.870
v. And so all we need to
do is substitute in our

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.880
formulas for dx here.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.110
So this tells us that dz
is, OK, so we have 2x--

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.700
instead of dx, we just plug in
here-- so we have 2u du minus

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.830
2v dv. So that was this term.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.850
And now we have plus 2y--

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.940
and now we just plug in this--

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:48.290
so v du plus u dv. You see?

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.010
It's just substitution.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.570
So then now, we just expand
everything out.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.020
And so we get--

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.020
OK, so let's collect all the
things involving du.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.850
So if we collect all the things
involving du we have--

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.480
2 times 2 times x times u--

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:17.240
4xu plus 2yv. This whole
quantity times du.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.720
And then if we collect the
terms in dv, we have 2yu.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:33.760
So that's coming from here,
and then we have

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:42.142
a minus 4xv. OK?

00:08:42.142 --> 00:08:43.392
And now what that tells
us is that--

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:53.540
so let's just remember that one
definition of the partial

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.350
derivative partial z partial
u is this coefficient.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.740
So if I go over here, if we
write the total differential

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:12.650
dz, we can write that as partial
z, partial u du plus

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:20.280
partial z, partial
v dv. Right?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.930
Well, look.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.710
What we have here on these two
sides is essentially the same

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.500
expression.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.540
So that means if we want to
compute partial z partial u,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.300
then that's just equal to
this coefficient here.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:41.150
So we get that partial z partial
u is 4xu plus 2--

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.810
that should be v. One
of those is an x.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.320
Let's see.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.650
So where did this come from.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.590
Yeah, one of those
is an x, sorry--

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.570
SPEAKER 1: It's a y.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.110
DAVID JORDAN: --is a y.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.130
2vy, OK.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.470
Now just as a sanity check, why
don't we go back to the

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.350
middle of the board, and
we'll see that we

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.200
got the same thing.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.690
So 4xu plus 2vy, that's
what we concluded for

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.000
partial z partial u.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.740
And then going back to the
middle of the board, that's we

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.620
found again.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.700
So let's just go over
the two different

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.510
methods and compare them.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.190
So if I'm in a rush to
do a computation--

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.970
maybe I'm taking an exam--

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.320
I definitely think it's the
quickest to just compute, to

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.990
figure out what the dependency
of the variable is, and I use

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.380
this dependency graph.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.870
And then I just trace all
the paths from z to the

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.260
independent variable u that
I'm interested in.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.190
And then I multiply all the
partial derivatives that

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.570
correspond to each edge and
I get an expression.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.440
Now if I have more time, then
I really prefer to use the

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.020
method of total differentials
that we did

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.290
on the third board.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.810
I like it, because once you do
some simple calculus, and then

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.765
after that it's just,
it's basic algebra.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.560
I find that I'm less
likely to make a

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.080
mistake doing that method.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.390
But as you saw, it involves
computing a lot more

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.810
derivatives that we didn't
actually use

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.800
in the final answer.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.620
For instance, when we computed
total differentials, we got an

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.570
expression for partial z partial
v at the end of the

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.120
day, even though we weren't
asked to do that.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.140
So it's lengthier, but I
think more conceptually

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.360
straightforward.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.070
So I think I'll leave
it at that.
