CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,650
In this video, I'd like
to do two problems that

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,720
ask us to determine the flux of
a vector field along a surface.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,890
So the first one is
I'd like you to find

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,240
the outward flux of the
vector z comma x comma

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,110
y through the piece of
the cylinder that's shown.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,930
So it's just shading
the cylindrical part.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,820
So it's a cylinder of
radius a, and you're

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,390
taking the piece in the
first octant up to height h.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,565
So that's the first question
I'd like you to answer,

11
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,690
is the flux of this vector
field through that piece

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,730
of the cylinder,
the outward flux.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,230
And then I'd also like you to
find the outward flux of this

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,480
vector field x*z comma y*z comma
z squared through the piece

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,990
of the sphere of radius
a in the first octant.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,069
So again, it will be
in the first octant,

17
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,610
like this one is in
the first octant.

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,151
It'll be the piece
of the sphere that

19
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,500
sits in the same part of
three-dimensional space

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,780
as the piece of the cylinder
we're looking at here.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,196
So what I'd like
you to do, again,

22
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,180
is just find the
flux-- in both cases,

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,150
the outward flux-- of the vector
listed through the surface that

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,711
is listed.

25
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,710
And then when you feel
comfortable and confident

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,819
with your answer, you can
bring the video back up

27
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,110
and I'll show you how I did it.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,016
OK, welcome back.

29
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,390
So again, what
we're trying to do

30
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,070
is determine flux of a vector
field through a surface.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,140
So I am going to determine
first what the normal is here,

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,190
and then what F dot
n is here, and then

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,150
using the fact
that I know F dot n

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,840
and I know dS in a
good parametrization,

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,215
I'm going to be
able to calculate

36
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:45,380
the integral quite simply.

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,940
So let's point out
first, that the normal

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,420
at any point on the
surface is going

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:59,360
to be equal to x comma
y comma 0 divided by a,

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,440
where a is, again, the radius.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,390
Because in the normal, I
know there's no z-component.

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,620
And I actually know it's
the same as the normal would

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,100
be on a circle of radius a.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,470
And so this vector x comma
y has length a obviously,

45
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,450
so that's why I'm dividing by a.

46
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,000
So when I look at the
normal and I dot it with F,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,930
let's see what I get.

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:30,310
F dotted with the normal
is going to be x*z plus x*y

49
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,390
divided by a, right?

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,365
So I just took x dotted
with x times z, y times z,

51
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,190
and 0 times y, I add
those up, and I still

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,620
have to divide by my a.

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,129
So that's actually the vector
dotted with the normal.

54
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,170
Now, what's a natural
parametrization to use here

55
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,878
is obviously the
cylindrical coordinates,

56
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,680
because I'm on a cylinder.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,410
The radius is fixed.

58
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,127
But what I'm interested in is
changes in theta and changes

59
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:55,710
in the height.

60
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,430
So I'm going to be
interested in d theta and dz,

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,180
and I need to understand
what dS in this case is.

62
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,850
And it's just a d theta dz.

63
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,100
So let me write
down what I'm going

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,970
to need to completely determine
the rest of number one

65
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,460
is I'm integrating
over the surface.

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,464
And I'll put the
bounds momentarily.

67
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,880
Actually, I should
also point out,

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,540
I'm going to write x
and y in terms of theta,

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,480
because now I know
what they are.

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,480
x in terms of theta is a cosine
theta, and y in terms of theta

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
is a sine theta.

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,400
So when I simplify the
expression F dot n,

73
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,380
I get z times cosine theta
for my first component.

74
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,810
And I get a times
cosine theta sine

75
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,210
theta for my second component.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,510
So let me maybe point
out again how I got that.

77
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,190
Let me come over here.

78
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,040
x is a cosine theta.

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
So I get z times a cosine
theta divided by a.

80
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,502
So I get z times cosine theta.

81
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:04,080
x again is a cosine
theta. y is a sine theta.

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,555
So I get a squared
cosine theta sine theta.

83
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:09,920
And I divide by a, so I get
a single a cosine theta sine

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
theta.

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,777
And then my dS, as I mentioned
before, is a d theta dz, right?

86
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:21,110
And so now I just have to
figure out the bounds in theta

87
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,050
and the bounds in z.

88
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,060
Well, the bounds
in z are very easy.

89
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,400
The bounds in z
are simply 0 to h,

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,870
and so I'm going to put
those here on the outside.

91
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,310
And then the bounds in theta.

92
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,640
Maybe it's helpful to come
over and look at my picture.

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,130
This direction, in the
x-direction, is theta equals 0.

94
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,980
When I swing around
to the y-direction,

95
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,870
I'm at theta equals pi over 2.

96
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,205
So I need to go from
0 to pi over 2, right?

97
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,455
So let me come back over here.

98
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,100
OK, so now, really,
I have a couple

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,480
of constants that are letters,
but everything now, I'm

100
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,420
ready to integrate.

101
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,800
So a is just a constant,
and h is a constant,

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,420
and z and theta
are my variables,

103
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,800
and I can actually do this
integration quite simply.

104
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,342
I'm not going to do
it because I know

105
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:13,758
this is at this point something
we already know how to do,

106
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:15,030
but I'll give you the answer.

107
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,770
So let me write down the answer.

108
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:26,230
You get a h squared over
2, plus a squared h over 2.

109
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,500
So that's the solution
you actually get.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,524
So again, I mean, you have to
integrate in d theta first.

111
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,940
So you have to deal with this,
you have to deal with this,

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,580
and this uses a
good trig identity.

113
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,070
You can use the fact
that 2 sine theta cosine

114
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,930
theta is sine 2 theta.

115
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,832
I'll give you that
little hint, and then you

116
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,040
can figure it out from there.

117
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,100
And then you integrate in z,
and you evaluate from 0 to h.

118
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,500
So that's the solution
to number one.

119
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,900
So now, let's look
at number two.

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,980
In number two, we
have to again figure

121
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,415
out-- we have our vector field
and we know our surface is

122
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:02,910
a piece of a sphere.

123
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,410
And so if we're
going to parametrize

124
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,270
the surface of a
sphere, we know we want

125
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,270
to use d theta and d phi, OK?

126
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,395
And let me point out first,
that again, the normal is going

127
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,090
to be in some ways similar to
what we saw on the cylinder,

128
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,450
but now instead of x comma y
comma 0, because it's a sphere,

129
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,770
it's going to be x comma
y comma z divided by a.

130
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,360
So again, as before, let me
just point out the normal

131
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,190
that I'm going to be using
is x comma y comma z,

132
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,420
all divided by a.

133
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,800
So I'm going to dot F with n
and look at the surface integral

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,250
with respect to dS--
d capital S there--

135
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,890
and I'll see what I get.

136
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,490
So again, I know how I'm going
to parametrize this sphere.

137
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,490
I already mentioned it,
but let me say it again.

138
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,584
It's going to be in
theta and phi, right?

139
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,000
Because we have a
constant radius.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,610
We're on a sphere of radius a.

141
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,970
So I don't need to change rho.

142
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,370
It's a two-dimensional thing.

143
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,620
So theta is varying
and phi is varying.

144
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,220
So let's see what we get first.

145
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
Let me do a little work
and see what we get when

146
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,170
we look at F dotted with n.

147
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,710
So let me first point out
that F dotted with n looks

148
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,940
like it's x squared
z plus y squared

149
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,970
z plus-- just to
make this obvious-- z

150
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,850
squared z, all divided by a.

151
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,860
x squared plus y squared plus
z squared is a squared, right?

152
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,750
So it's actually a squared
times z divided by a.

153
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,460
So it's just a times z, right?

154
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,860
So far, all I've done was
I dotted F with the normal,

155
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,280
and I knew the fact that x
squared plus y squared plus z

156
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,030
squared was a squared, because
I was on a sphere of radius a.

157
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,920
So a squared times z
divided by a is a times z.

158
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,880
And now, if I want to use
the right coordinates,

159
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,510
think about theta and phi.

160
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,280
z is a cosine phi.

161
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,440
So F dot n in the
coordinates I'm interested in

162
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,990
is going to be a
squared cosine phi.

163
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,760
So let me get out of the
way so you can see that.

164
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,364
So that's what our
F dot n will be.

165
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,780
And now, if we're going to
figure out the flux, of course,

166
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,560
it's the integral of F dot n dS.

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,200
And let's remind
ourselves what dS is.

168
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:28,320
dS is going to be a squared
sine phi d theta d phi.

169
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,270
You saw this in
lecture, actually, also.

170
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,270
So this should look familiar.

171
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,410
And so now I just have
to integrate F dot n

172
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,910
dS over the right bounds
for theta and phi.

173
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,426
So let's determine
what those are.

174
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:42,050
I'll put everything
together, and we'll

175
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,160
determine what those are.

176
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,950
So I've got F dot n dS.

177
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:55,370
That's going to be a to the
fourth sine phi cosine phi

178
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,830
d theta d phi.

179
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,110
And let's think about
what is the picture

180
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,570
that I need in terms of the
first octant of a sphere.

181
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,460
Maybe I should draw a
quick picture over here

182
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,800
so we can remember
what that looks like.

183
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,921
So it's going to
be-- this is not

184
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,920
going to be the greatest
drawing ever-- but it's

185
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,500
something like this.

186
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,310
And so I've got pieces of
a circle at each level.

187
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,704
I've got a piece
of a circle, right?

188
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,870
If this is the x-direction,
this is the y-direction,

189
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,190
and this is the z-direction,
theta is going from 0-- again--

190
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:40,310
to pi over 2, and phi is going
from 0 to pi over 2, right?

191
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,060
So they're both going
from 0 to pi over 2.

192
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
So hopefully, you were able
to get this far at least,

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,320
in terms of figuring
out the flux of F

194
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,490
through that piece
of the sphere.

195
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,100
And I'm, again, just going
to write down the solution,

196
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,790
and then you can check your
answer against the solution.

197
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,930
And I got a to the
fourth over 4 times pi.

198
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,900
So this whole solution
is a to the fourth

199
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,270
divided by 4 times pi.

200
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,232
So you can check
your solution there.

201
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:14,690
Again, I want to
point out, what we

202
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,110
did in both of these
problems is we were trying

203
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,070
to compute the flux of a certain
vector field through a surface.

204
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,860
And if you'll notice, what
I actually did in this case

205
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,090
is I kept the parametrization in
terms of the x, y, z variables

206
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,040
first, and then I put it
in the parametrization

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,550
of theta and phi after.

208
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,540
And that made it a little easier
to hang on to and figure out

209
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,040
what it was.

210
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,470
Because notice, that x, y,
and z become very complicated

211
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,070
in theta and phi.

212
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,780
I have to write a lot
more down, I guess.

213
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,590
And then simplify
things more carefully.

214
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,760
This way, it was very obvious
that I got an a squared times

215
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,030
z in the numerator.

216
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,030
So sometimes it's
a little easier

217
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,650
to compute the F dot n in the
initial x, y, z variables,

218
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,320
and then change it to the
appropriate parametrization

219
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,887
for the surface
you're looking at.

220
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:03,220
So that's what we did, actually.

221
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,140
In both cases we
computed F dot n,

222
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,550
we put it in the
right parametrization,

223
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,340
and then we had to
figure out what dS was.

224
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,220
We had to make sure
we knew dS, and then

225
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,440
we just had to integrate
over the appropriate bounds

226
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,670
for our parameters.

227
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,230
And that's giving us the
flux across the surface.

228
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,915
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
