JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.990
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.540
In lecture, you've been learning
about line integrals

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.800
and computing them around curves
and closed curves and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.140
in various different ways.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.820
So here I have some problems
on line integrals for you.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.070
So in all cases I want C to
be the circle of radius b.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.090
So b is some constant, some
positive constant.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.500
It's the circle of radius b
centered at the origin, and I

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.590
want to orient it
counterclockwise.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.340
And then what I'd like you
to do is for each of the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.980
following vector fields F, I'd
like you to compute the line

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.160
integral around C of F dot dr.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.850
So in the first case, where
F is xi plus yj.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.200
In the second, where F is
g(xy) times (xi + yj).

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.680
So here g of xy is some
scalar function.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.810
But you don't know a formula
for this function.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.445
So your answer might be in
terms of g, for example.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.550
You can assume it's a
continuous, differentiable

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.440
nice function.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.630
And then the third one,
F is -yi plus xj.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.060
Now before you start, I want
to give you a little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.460
suggestion, which is often
when we're given a line

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.530
integral like this, the first
thing you want to do is jump

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.020
in and do a parameterization
right away for the curve, and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.450
then you get a normal single
variable integral.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.410
So what I'd like you to do for
these problems is to think

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.720
about the setup and think about
whether you can do this

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.280
without ever parameterizing C,
so without ever substituting

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.600
in cosine and sine
or whatever.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.040
So for all three parts
of this problem.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.800
So if you can use some sort of
geometric reasoning to save

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.730
yourself a little bit of work
without ever going to the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.960
parameterization.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200
So why don't you pause the
video, spend some time, work

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.030
that out, come back, and we
can work it out together.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.190
Hopefully you had some luck
working on these problems.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.540
Let's get started.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.080
So let's do the first problem
first. Let's think about what

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.660
this vector field
F looks like.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.570
This first vector field.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.360
So let me just draw a little
picture over here.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.330
So here's our circle
of radius b.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.480
And this vector field F given by
xi plus yj, at every point

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.380
(x,y), the vector F is the same
as the position vector of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.110
that point.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.220
So over here the vector's
like that.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.310
Over here, the vector's
like that.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.700
Up here, the vector
is like that.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.780
So these are just a few little
values of F that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.630
I've drawn in there.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.520
And so down here, say,
F is like that.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.130
So in particular, so that's just
sort of, you know, if you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.010
wanted, you could draw in some
more vectors, get a full

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.050
vector field picture.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.010
So the thing to observe here is
that a circle is a really

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.040
nice curve.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.550
So the circle has the property
that the position vector at a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.640
point is orthogonal to the
tangent vector to the circle.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.410
At every point on the circle,
the tangent vector to the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.440
circle is perpendicular to
the position vector.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.460
So that means it's perpendicular
to F, because F

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.020
is the same, in fact,
but is parallel to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.960
the position vector.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.600
So in Part a, you have that F
dot the tangent vector to your

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.690
curve is equal to zero
at every point

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.490
on the entire curve.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.290
All right?

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.530
So your field F dot your tangent
vector is always zero.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.030
So that means that the integral
around C of F dot dr,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.610
well, we know that dr is T ds.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.090
So this is F dot T ds.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.420
But that's just zero.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.100
It's just an integral and the
integrand is zero everywhere.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.110
And whenever you take a definite
integral of something

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.040
that's zero everywhere,
you get zero.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.860
So this is just zero
right away.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.840
We didn't have to parameterize
the curve or anything.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.900
We just had to look at this
picture to sort of understand

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.870
that this kind of field, it's
called a radial vector field,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.830
where the vector F is always
pointed directly outwards.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.800
When you integrate a radial
vector field around a circle

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.960
centered at the origin, you
get zero, because the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.720
contribution at every
point is zero.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.930
So that's Part a.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.050
Part b is actually
exactly the same.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.370
If we look back at our formula
over here in Part b, we have

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.370
that F is given by some
function g(xy) times

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.040
(xi hat + yj hat).

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.230
Well, what is this
g of xy doing?

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.660
It's just rescaling.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.960
It's telling you every point you
can scale that vector by

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.530
some amount.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.250
So if we looked over at this
picture, maybe over here you

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.620
would scale some of these
vectors to be longer, and over

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.270
here they might be shorter, or
you might switch them to be

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.020
negative, but you don't change
the direction of any vector in

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.970
the field from Part a.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.630
You just change their length.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.640
So you still have a radial
vector field.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.250
And you still have the property
that at every point

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.960
on our curve, the tangent
vector to the curve is

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.410
orthogonal to the vector F.
So the tangent vector is

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.020
orthogonal to F, so that means
you again have F dot T is

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.890
equal to zero.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.700
And so F dot dr is also equal
to 0 ds, and so when you

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.380
integrate that, you
just get zero.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.560
So that's also what
happens in Part b.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.000
So Part b, I'm just going
to write ditto.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.600
The exact same reasoning
applies in Part b as

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
applied in Part a.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.410
And you also get zero as your
integral without having to

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.530
parameterize, without having
to do any tricky

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.030
calculations at all.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.390
All right.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.600
So let's now look at Part c.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.330
I'm going to draw another
little picture.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.620
So in Part c, there's
your curve.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.510
At the point (x,y)--

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.370
so I'm going to draw some
choices of F again.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:37.520
So in Part c, at the point
(x,y), your vector field F is

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.600
-y i hat plus x j hat.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.390
Now if you draw that on the
picture here, over there

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.480
that's that vector.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.880
Over here, so at the point
(0,1), say, that gives you the

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.970
vector {-1, 0}.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.660
So that's horizontal
to the left.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.360
Here are some more.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.520
There's one there, there's
one there.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.450
There's another one over
here and so on.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.460
In fact, what you'll notice is
that this vector F is just

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.280
parallel to the tangent vector
of the circle everywhere.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.360
This field is a tangential
field.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.340
It's always pointing parallel
to the curve.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.590
OK?

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.020
It's perpendicular to
the position vector.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.210
It's in the same direction
as the tangent

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.050
vector at every point.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.830
So this is something that you've
seen before, I think.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.560
That this vector field is giving
you a sort of nice

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.160
rotating motion.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.640
You know, at every point it's
circulating counterclockwise.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.610
So what does that mean?

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.740
Well, again, it's not exactly
the same as Part a and b, but

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.410
again we'll be able to compute
this integral without

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.280
parameterizing.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.960
Why?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.580
Because F dot T in this case--

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.170
well, so, let's see.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.070
What is the norm of F?

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.180
The magnitude of F is just the
square root of (x squared plus

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.940
y squared).

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.050
So on our circle of radius
b, that means the

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.940
magnitude of F is b.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.240
And the magnitude of T, the unit
tangent vector, is 1, and

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.870
they point in the
same direction.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.550
So when you have two vectors
that point in the same

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.360
direction, their dot product is
just the product of their

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.190
magnitudes.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.340
So that means F dot
T is equal to b.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.630
This is a constant.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.050
F dot T is equal to b.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.600
So when you integrate around
the circle, F dot dr, well,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:41.760
this is equal to the integral
around a circle of F dot the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.900
tangent vector with respect
to arc length.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.230
But this integrand, F dot the
tangent vector, is this

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.250
constant b.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.210
So you're integrating
over the curve b ds.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.720
And when you integrate a
constant ds, well, that just

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.180
gives you the total
arc length.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.730
So this is b times the
total arc length.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.310
And this is a circle
of radius b.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:10.120
So that's b times 2 pi b, which
we could also write as 2

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.810
pi b squared.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.400
So there you go.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.260
So in this third case,
you have a nice

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.890
tangential vector field.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.700
So that means the integrand
actually

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.630
works out to be constant.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.110
Because the integrand is
constant, we don't ever have

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.100
to parameterize the curve.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.640
We can just use the fact that we
already know its arc length

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.170
in order to compute
this integral.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.180
Again, we could do all of these
integrals if we wanted

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.640
by parameterizing the circle,
by x equals b cosine T, y

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.340
equals b sine T, and going
through and writing this as an

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.510
integral from T equals
0 to 2 pi, and so on.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.420
But these are examples of
problems where it's helpful to

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.000
think about what's going on
first, see if you can

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.320
understand the geometry
of your situation.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.180
And sometimes you'll
have a problem

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.950
like this where you'll--

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.080
either in this class or
elsewhere in your life--

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.000
where something that might seem
complicated has a simple

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.410
geometric explanation.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.770
And so when that does happen,
it's nice when you can take

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.640
advantage of it.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.830
Sometimes that won't happen and
sometimes you'll have to

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.020
do the parameterization
and the computation.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.000
But in these cases we have
these nice three examples

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.230
where with a radial vector
field, you get that the

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.240
integrand is always zero, or
with a tangential vector

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.836
field, you have that the
integrand is constant.

00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:31.190
All right.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.360
So, I'll stop there.
