JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.390
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.930
In lecture, you've been learning
about how to solve

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.690
multivariable optimization
problems using the method of

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.230
Lagrange multipliers, and I have
a nice problem here for

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.830
you that can be solved
that way.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.540
So in this problem, we've got
an ellipse, the ellipse with

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.320
equation x squared plus for
4y squared equals 4.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.970
So that's this ellipse, and we
want to inscribe a rectangle

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.140
in it, so here I mean actually
a rectangle whose edges are

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.180
parallel to the axes.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.910
So I want to inscribe a
rectangle in this ellipse, and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.940
among all such rectangles, I
want to find the one with the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.450
largest perimeter.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.750
So I want to find the maximal
perimeter of a rectangle that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.840
can be inscribed in
this ellipse.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.110
So why don't you have a go at
solving this problem, pause

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.780
the video, work it out,
come back, and we

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.030
can work it out together.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.680
So hopefully, you've had some
luck working on this problem.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440
Let's get started on it.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.780
So one thing we need to start is
we need to figure out a way

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.760
to sort of describe these
rectangles in a way that will

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300
let us describe their perimeter,
write down what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.120
their perimeter is.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.530
So a natural way to do that is
to call this upper right-hand

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.700
corner of the rectangle, to
call it the point x, y.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.640
So x, y is going to be that
upper right-hand corner of the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.620
rectangle, and it's going to
be ranging over the region

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.500
from this topmost point on the
ellipse down to this rightmost

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.070
point on the ellipse, on this
quarter arc of the ellipse.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.840
So if that point is x, y, we
need to figure out what is the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810
perimeter that we're
trying to optimize.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.610
So the perimeter here, P, which
is a function of x and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.620
y-- well, so x is this distance,
so the length of the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.700
horizontal edge of the rectangle
is 2x, and we've got

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.440
two of those, so that's 4x from
the horizontal sides.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.590
And then this height is y, so
the length of the vertical

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.580
side of the rectangle is 2y, so
the perimeter is going to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.580
be 4x plus 4y.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.680
So that's our objective function
that we're trying to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.130
optimize, that we're trying
to find the maximum of.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.520
And we also have the constraint
function g, which

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.980
is x squared plus 4y squared,
and the constraint is that g

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.330
is equal to 4.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.050
So we have the objective
function P--

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.600
P of x, y-- and we have this
constraint function g, and so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
we want to write down some
equations using Lagrange

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.720
multipliers whose solutions
will correspond to the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.100
possible maximum points of P.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.340
So what are those equations?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.885
Well, we need that the gradient
of P is parallel to

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:03.660
the gradient g.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.090
So that means that we need Px
is equal to lambda times gx

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.720
and Py is equal to lambda
times gy for

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.020
some value of lambda.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.350
We need to find a value of
lambda that makes this true.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.940
And then also, our third
equation is the constraint

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.840
equation, that g
is equal to 4.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.690
So what is Px equal lambda gx
translate to in our case?

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.560
Let's just draw a line here.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.200
So in our case, Px is the x
partial derivative of 4x plus

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.750
4y, so that's just 4, and gx, we
take the partial derivative

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.870
with respect to x of x squared
plus 4y squared, and that's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.610
equal to 2x, so 4 is equal
to lambda times 2x.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.830
And from taking the y partial
derivatives, we have that the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.980
y partial derivative a P is 4,
Py is 4, and gy is going to be

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.570
the y partial derivative of x
squared plus 4y squared, so

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:14.110
that's 8y, so 4 equals lambda
times 8y, and we also have the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.830
constraint equation x squared
plus 4y squared equals 4.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.210
So we need to solve these three
equations, and we need

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.050
to figure out which values of
x and y are the solutions.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.430
So I think the simplest way to
proceed here is to note that

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.710
from the first equation and the
second equation, we can

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.790
eliminate lambda between them,
and what we'll see is that x

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.660
has to be exactly four times as
large as y for this to be

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.560
true, for both of these
equations to be

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.830
true at the same time.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.200
So we need x to be
equal to 4y.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:01.360
So from the first two equations,
we have that x is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.180
equal to 4y, and now we can
substitute that in to the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.090
constraint equation.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.940
So if x is 4y, then x squared
is 16y squared, so x squared

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.720
plus 4y squared is
20y squared.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.870
So we have 20y squared
is equal to 4.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.270
And OK, so we can solve
this for y.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.420
We can divide by 20 and
take a square root,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.930
so we get that y--

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.010
well, so y squared is equal to
1/5, so y is equal to plus or

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.010
minus 1 over the square
root of 5.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.380
But remember, come back over
here, we've taken x, y to be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.880
the upper right-hand corner,
this first quadrant corner of

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.190
our rectangle, so y is
always positive.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.520
So we had that y squared equals
1/5 and y is positive,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.940
so there's actually
only one root.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.760
We don't need to consider
the negative root.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.720
So over here, we know that
y is 1 divided by the

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.140
square root of 5.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.810
OK, so that's y.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.450
Now what's x?

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.950
Well, OK, so we solve for x in
terms of y, so x is equal to 4

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.580
over the square root of 5.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.930
So Lagrange multipliers, when we
use the method of Lagrange

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.390
multipliers, we get this one
possible point at which we

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.030
have to check to
be the maximum.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.850
But remember that when you're
using Lagrange multipliers,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.320
you also have to worry about
the boundary of the region

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.310
that you're interested in.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.450
So let's go look at
our picture again.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.670
So over on our picture, this
point x, y moved along the arc

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.670
connecting the topmost point
of the ellipse to the

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.060
rightmost point of
the ellipse.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.710
So we also have to look at the
perimeters when the point is

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.920
the topmost point and when the
point is the rightmost point.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.500
Now, in those two cases, the
rectangle is a sort of

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.410
degenerate rectangle, and when
x, y is this point 0, 1, it's

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.030
sort of two copies of this
vertical line, this minor

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.000
axis, and when x, y is the point
2, 0, then our rectangle

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.670
just looks like the major
axis, which is

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.890
that horizontal line.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.480
But we still have to check those
cases to see whether our

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.760
function has a maximum
and what it is.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.010
So we need to compute the
objective function value at

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.050
this point and we need to
compute it at those endpoints.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.220
So we need to look at P of--

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.680
so this is our point 4 over the
square root of 5 comma 1

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.440
over the square root of 5, and
we know that P of x, y is 4x

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.530
plus 4y, so that's equal to 20
over the square root of 5,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.120
which we can also write as 4
times the square root of 5.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.340
And we also need to check those
two endpoints, so we

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.440
need to check the point P of 0,
1, so that's 4, and we need

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.720
to check the point P of
2, 0, so that's 8.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.030
So in order to find out what the
maximum value of P is, we

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.590
need to compare the value of P
at the points given to us by

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.030
Lagrange multipliers and at
the boundary points of the

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.920
region, which in this case are
the endpoints of the arc.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.360
So we need to compare the
numbers 4 square root of 5, 4

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.140
and 8, and indeed, 4
square root of 5 is

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.090
the largest of these.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.110
So this is the largest, so
this is actually the

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.190
maximum value, OK?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:42.210
So the maximum perimeter is
4 square root of 5 when

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:50.100
rectangle has its upper
rightmost vertex at this

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:57.330
point: 4 over square root of 5
comma 1 over square root of 5.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.100
So our rectangle's maximal
perimeter is 4 root 5, and

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.820
that occurs when the upper
right-hand vertex is at the

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.170
point 4 over root 5,
1 over root 5.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.800
So to quickly recap, we wanted
to apply the method of

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.050
Lagrange multipliers
to this problem.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.890
So we chose to keep track of our
rectangles by their upper

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.170
right-hand corner.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.880
And then that gave us-- the
perimeter was 4x plus 4y.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.240
That was our objective
function.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.340
And the constraint was that that
upper right-hand corner

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.590
actually had to lie
on the ellipse.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:36.615
So then we set the gradients of
the two functions equal and

00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:41.540
solved the system of equations
that we get by having those--

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.350
sorry, the gradients not to be
equal, but to be parallel.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.160
There's some constant multiple
lambda that appears.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.080
So we set the gradients to be
parallel to each other and the

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.640
constraint equation to hold,
and we solved those three

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.270
equation simultaneously
for x and y.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.940
And those equations gave us one
point that we had to check

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.900
to be the maximum, and we also
needed to check points on the

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.770
boundary of the region
in question.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:14.280
So here, those were just the
two points 0, 1 and 2, 0.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.140
So I'll end there.
