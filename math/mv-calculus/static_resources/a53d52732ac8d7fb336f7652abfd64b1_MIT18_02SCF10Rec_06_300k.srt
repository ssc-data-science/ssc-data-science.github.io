DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:12,180
I'd like to work on a problem
with you, which is to compute

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,910
the volume of a parallelepiped
using 3 by 3 determinants.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,140
So here we've got the
parallelepiped drawn.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,550
It has, one of its vertices
is at the origin--

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,090
0, 0, 0--

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,860
and the other three edges are
given to us with these

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,590
coordinates here.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,420
So why don't you take some time
to work out this problem,

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,980
pause the video, and check back
with me and I'll show you

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,230
how I solved it.

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:44,190

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,880
OK, welcome back.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,350
Let's get started.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,380
So the first thing that we
need to do is we need to

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,270
remember that computing volumes
of parallelepipeds is

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,970
the same thing as computing
3 by 3 determinants.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:10,910
So the volume is just equal to
the determinant, which is

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,460
built out of the vectors,
the row vectors

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,710
determining the edges.

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:26,930

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,990
So we have-- well, that's
almost true.

24
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,135
This determinant will be either
a positive or negative

25
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,140
number and we always want to
take the positive number.

26
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,540
So I'm going to write plus or
minus here, and we'll have to

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,320
remember at the end that we
want a positive number.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,380
So we can compute this
determinant using Laplace

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,040
expansion as we did
in the last video.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,680

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,030
So for Laplace expansion, we
take, can do Laplace expansion

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,470
on the first row.

33
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,090
And that will again be nice,
because this 0 here will make

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,770
our computation simpler.

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,050
And so, remember what we do is
we take the first entry in the

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,340
row, and then we need to
multiply by the minor that we

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,480
get by covering up that
row and that column.

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,940
So we have this little 2
by 2 determinant, which

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,273
looks like minus 1.

40
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:16,310

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,450
And now we need to subtract
the next entry in the row

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,360
times its minor, which is now
this matrix 1, 1, 0, 1.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,080

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,060
So taking that determinant,
we get 1 minus 0.

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,430
So altogether, we get 1.

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,860
So what that tells us is that
our determinant is minus 4.

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,180
But then that tells us that
our volume is plus 4.

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,950
And I'll leave it at that.

49
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,109
