00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.838
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.510
In this video I would like us
to do the following problem.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.950
We're going to let z equal x
squared plus y and we want S

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.610
to be the graph of z above the
unit square in the x-y plane.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.030
And what we'd like to do is
for F equal to zi plus xk,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.720
find the upward flux of F
through S. So S is our surface

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.770
that's a graph over the x-y
plane and the unit square of z

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.490
equal to x squared plus y.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.650
And we want to compute
the upward flux of F

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.330
through that surface.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.600
So why don't you work on this
problem, pause the video, and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020
then when you're ready to
see my solution, bring

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.270
the video back up.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.360
OK, welcome back.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.440
So again what we want to do is
we want to find the upward

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.520
flux of F through this surface
S. And let's think about

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.840
first, how do we describe
the surface S?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.240
S is the graph of z equal
x squared plus y.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.060
So we can think of it as, z is
really a function of x and y

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.250
over the unit square.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.300
So we can say F of x, y is equal
to z which is equal to x

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.430
squared plus y.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.060
And then we know how to
compute the normal--

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.120
well, we know how to compute n
dS, which also in class is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.080
sometimes written notationally
as dS with the vector dS.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.690
So we know how to compute
this form right here.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.220
And it is-- you were shown
in class that if F is--

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.840
or sorry.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.240
If you have a graph, if your
surface is a graph, then this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.070
is exactly equal to the vector
minus f sub x comma minus f

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.100
sub y comma 1 dx dy.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.470
So that's exactly
what this n dS--

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.510
so n is the vector, and dS is
the surface form we have here.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.030
So n dS is exactly equal to
the vector minus f sub x,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.250
minus f sub y, 1, dx dy.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
So what do we have here with
f sub x? f sub x--

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.420
because f is equal to z-- f sub
x is 2x and f sub y is 1.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.800
So in our case we get exactly
minus 2x, comma minus

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.000
1, comma 1, dx dy.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.660
And now to compute the surface
integral what we do--

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.000
or sorry, to compute the flux
along the surface--

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.890
what we do is we integrate
over the surface--

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.590
which I guess we should remember
that's a double

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.610
integral, because it's
over a surface--

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.620
of F dotted with dS.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.060
But that's the same as
integrating over the region.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.240
So we have this surface, we
know the region below that

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.780
defines the surface in
the x-y coordinates.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.370
So it's integrating over the
region of F dotted with this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.810
vector here.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.590
Because n dS, dS is n dS and
in the x-y components it's

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.400
exactly equal to this.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
Minus 2x, minus 1, 1, dx dy.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.660
So now we're integrating.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.140
We've gone from looking
at a surface integral.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.090
Now we're integrating--

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.210
we were integrating F dot dS on
the surface, to now taking

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.880
F dotted with this vector on
the region in the x-y plane

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.800
over which we can define S.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.670
So the region we're
interested in,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.320
remember, is the unit square.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.510
So we have the unit square which
is x goes from 0 to 1

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.480
and y goes from 0 to 1.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.560
And then what we're doing is
we're looking at F as a

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.050
function of x, y, and z.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.230
And we want to dot that
with this vector.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.300
And it's all being done in
the variables x and y.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.660
So we should be able to change
everything to x and y

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.740
ultimately.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.160
So let's look at what we
get when we do that.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.980
So F--

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm going to remind myself--

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.600
F was equal to zi plus xk.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.290
Which, if I write that in the
component form, it's z comma,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.710
0 comma, x.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.080
So F dotted with our minus
f sub x minus f sub y 1--

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.750
which was minus 2x,
minus 1, 1--

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.150
we see we get--

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.030
minus 2x dotted with z-- we get
minus 2xz and then we get

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.760
0 and then we get x.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.180
So we get minus 2xz plus x.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.510
That's exactly what f dotted
with the vector we have is.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.890
So now also we know that z was
equal to x squared plus y.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.870
So we actually get negative
2x times x squared

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.980
plus y plus x again.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.870
So I'm going to just
expand that so it's

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.130
easier to deal with.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:29.740
So we get negative 2x cubed
minus 2xy plus x.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.310
And now we have exactly what--

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.990
if we look over here-- we have
exactly this entire part here

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.420
written as a function
of x and y.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.030
Which is good.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.770
Why is that good?

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.920
Because everything we're
integrating is in x and y.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.480
We're doing dx and dy so we just
need to figure out the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.540
bounds and compute
the integral.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.490
So let's come over here.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.410
So the flux then is going to
be equal to-- well, we know

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.070
the region.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.630
We know the region is y and x
are both going from 0 to 1.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.100
So the order doesn't matter
because nothing depends on

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.260
another function.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.400
And then we're integrating
exactly this function.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.540
Negative 2x to the third
minus 2xy plus x dy dx.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.330
So when we integrate
in y, we should be

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.570
careful what we get here.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.350
We're going to have the integral
from 0 to 1, and then

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.340
we're going to have--

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.720
this we get a negative 2x
cubed times y, and then

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.390
evaluate it at 0 and 1.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.350
So we just get a negative
2x cubed again.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.550
We integrate this we have a
negative 2xy squared over 2.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.290
So at 0 we get nothing
and at 1 we get 1/2.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.680
And so we get minus 2x.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.360
And then here when we integrate
in y, we get x times

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.420
y and we evaluate that at 1 and
0, and we got just plus x.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.740
So let me just make
sure I didn't make

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.220
any mistakes there.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.640
So this one, I'm integrating
it in y and so I get a

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.610
negative 2x cubed y, evaluated
at 0 and 1.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.860
So at 1 I just get a negative
2x cubed, at 0 I get 0.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.130
In this one, I have
a negative 2xy.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.870
When I integrate that I get
a y squared over 2.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.740
The 2s kill off.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.890
So I'm left with a negative
of xy squared.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.680
Evaluating that at 0 and 1, at
0 I get 0 and at 1 I get

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.290
negative x.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.740
Oh, there.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.760
So there shouldn't
be a 2 there.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.660
And then here when I integrate
that I get xy evaluated at y

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.900
equals 0 and y equals 1, and
take that difference.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.540
And at 1 I get just x and
at 0 I get nothing.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.030
Hopefully that one
is correct now.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.850
Because I forgot to kill off
the 2 there first. So those

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.140
subtract off and I'm left with
minus the integral from 0 to 1

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.620
of 2x cubed dx.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.195
Well, that's going to be minus
of x cubed, it's going to be x

00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:58.590
to the fourth over 4.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.020
And then I have the
2 still here.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.460
So that will divide out.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.650
Evaluate at 0 and 1.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.170
At 0 I obviously get nothing.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.980
At 1 I get negative 1/2.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.120
And so the flux of F across
the surface is equal to

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.190
negative 1/2.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.140
And that's the upward flux.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.960
So obviously if I wanted to know
the downward flux, that

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.000
would be positive 1/2.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.120
It doesn't have anything
to do with what F is.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.590
It has to do with the direction
of the normal that

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.750
I'm dotting F with.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.200
So since I was dotting F with
the upward normal--

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.480
which is the ndS that I showed
you was the upward normal--

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.500
then I know that this
is the upward flux.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.014
So let me just remind you
what we did here.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.010
Let's come back to the
very beginning.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.900
So the object was that we had
z as a function of x and y.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.490
So we knew we had a surface
sitting over some region in

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.600
the x-y plane.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.640
And we wanted to compute
the flux of a

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.850
certain vector field--

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.580
the upward flux of a certain
vector field--

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.220
across that surface.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.010
And so all we had to do to
solve this problem was

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.220
ultimately understand what n
dS was-- which you actually

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:03.990
did in class.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.640
You saw what n dS is,
this is the upward

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.310
normal through the surface.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.470
And then recognize
that the flux--

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.170
again, we saw this from class--
that the flux is equal

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.880
to the double integral over the
surface of F dot dS, which

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.780
is the same as the double
integral over the region of F

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.520
dotted with n dS.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.500
Where ndS now I'm referring to
as n is the vector and dS is--

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.770
this whole component is ndS--

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.860
that's what we found.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.210
And so then we know F. It's
in terms of z, x, and y.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.480
But then we can find it
in terms of x and y.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.470
When we take that dot product we
end up with exactly just a

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.750
function of x and y, when we
replace z by what it actually

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.860
is equal to.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.570
And then we just compute
the integral.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.510
And this is just a regular
old double integral.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.510
And we get the flux was
equal to minus 1/2.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.570
And again, I want to point out
that if we wanted instead of

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.510
the upward flux the downward
flux, it would be the same

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.770
with the opposite sign.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.210
OK.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.580
That is where I think
I'll stop.
