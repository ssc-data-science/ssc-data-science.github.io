00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.690
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.360
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.560
In lecture, you've
been learning

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.600
about Stoke's Theorem.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.980
And I have a nice question
here for you that can put

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.580
Stoke's Theorem to the test.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.880
So what I'd like you to do is
I'd like you to consider this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.910
field F. So its components
are 2z, x, and y.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.450
And the surface S that is the
top half of the unit sphere.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.070
So it's the sphere of radius 1
centered at the origin, but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.080
only its top half.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.540
Only the part where z is greater
than or equal to 0.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.600
So what I'd like you to do is to
verify Stoke's Theorem for

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.540
this surface.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.950
So that is, I'd like you to
compute the surface integral

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.470
that comes from Stoke's Theorem
for this surface, and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.980
the line integral that comes
from Stoke's Theorem for the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.770
surface, and check that
they're really

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.030
equal to each other.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.320
Now, before we start, we should
just say one brief

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.610
thing about compatible
orientation.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.130
So I didn't give you any
orientations, but of course,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.240
it doesn't matter as long as
you choose ones that are

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.170
compatible.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.130
So if you think about your
rules that you have for

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.620
finding them.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.540
So if you imagine yourself
walking along this boundary

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.940
circle with your left hand
out over that sphere.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.270
So you'll be walking in this
counterclockwise direction

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.040
when your head is sticking
out of the sphere.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.470
All right?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.040
So in other words, the outward
orientation on the sphere is

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640
compatible with the
counterclockwise orientation

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.130
on the circle that
is the boundary.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.190
So let's actually put in a
little arrow here to just

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.835
indicate that is our orientation
for the circle.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.010
And our normal is an
outward-pointing normal.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.060
And let's call our circle
C, and our S is our

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.620
sphere is our surface.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.230
OK.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.810
So just so we have the
same notation.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.200
Good.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.950
So why don't you work this
out, compute the line

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.890
integral, compute the surface
integral, come back, and we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.140
can work them out together.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.300
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.260
We have two things to compute.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.500
I think I'm going to start
with the line integral.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.960
So let me write that down:
line integral.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.370
So what I need to do to compute
the line integral is I

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:37.170
need to compute the integral
over the curve C of F dot dr.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.290
And so I know what F
is on that circle.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.680
So I need to know what dr is.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.610
So I need to know what r is.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.400
I need a parametrization
of circle.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.870
Well, you know, that is a
pretty easy circle to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.440
parametrize.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.800
It's the unit circle
in the xy plane.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.690
So we have C. And we're
wandering around it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.760
counterclockwise.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.670
So it's our usual
parametrization.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.360
It's the one we like.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.030
So we have x equals cosine
t, y equals sine t--

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.660
where t goes from 0 to 2 pi--

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.200
and this is in three dimensions,
so the other part

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.730
of the parametrization
is z equals 0.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.310
So this is my parametrization
of this circle.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.370
OK, so let's go ahead
and put that in.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:41.460
So the integral over C
of F dot dr is the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.370
integral from 0 to 2 pi.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.390
So we've got three parts.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.030
So F is 2z, x, y.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.690
So it's 2z dx plus
x dy plus y dz.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.900
But z is 0 on this
whole circle.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.190
So that piece just dies.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.470
And dz is also 0, so that
piece just dies.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.490
So we're just left with x dy.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.850
So this is equal to
the integral x dy.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.020
Oh.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.620
So I guess this is not
from 0 to 2 pi.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.570
This is still over C.
Sorry about that.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.910
OK.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.805
And now I change to my
parametrization.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:26.170
OK.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.730
Yes.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.940
Right.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.430
So this is still in dx dy dz
form, so it's still over C.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.700
Now we switch to the dt
form, so now t is

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.230
going from 0 to 2 pi.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.550
OK, so now we have x dy.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.750
So x is cosine t, and dy--

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.430
so y is sine t--

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.680
so dy is cosine t dt.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.090
So this is cosine t times cosine
t is cosine squared t.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.820
dt, gosh.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.040
So now you have to remember
way back in 18.01 when you

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.920
learned how to compute trig
integrals like this.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.660
So I think the thing that we
do when we have a cosine

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.410
squared t is we use a
half-angle formula.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.900
So let me come back down
here just to finish

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.190
this off in one board.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.570
OK, so cosine squared t is the
integral from 0 to 2 pi.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:20.410
So cosine squared t is 1 plus
cosine 2t over 2, dt.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.110
And now cosine 2t--

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.720
as t goes between 0 and 2 pi--

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.600
well, that's two whole
loops of it.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.880
Right?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.650
Two whole periods
of cosine 2t.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.280
And it's a trig function.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.680
It's a nice cosine function.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.670
So the positive parts and the
negative parts cancel.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.200
The cosine 2t part, when we
integrate it from 0 to 2 pi,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.830
that gives us 0.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.550
So we're left with 1/2
integrated from 0 to 2 pi, and

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.202
that's just going to give us
1/2 of 2 pi, so that's pi.

00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:50.980
All right.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.480
So good.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.700
So that was the line integral.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.540
A very straightforward thing.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.910
We had our circle back here.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.150
We had our field.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.530
So we parametrized the
curve that is the

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.500
circle that is the boundary.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.110
And then we just computed the
line integral, and it was a

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.750
nice, easy one to do.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.740
You had to remember one
little trig identity

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.170
in order to do it.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.230
All right.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.360
That's the first one.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.290
So let's go on to the
surface integral.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.870
So the surface integral that you
have to compute in Stoke's

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.120
Theorem is you have to compute
the double integral over your

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:43.090
surface of the curl of F dot n
with respect to surface area.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.610
So this is the integral we
want to compute here.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.210
So OK.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.580
So the first thing we're going
to need is we're going to need

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.270
to find the curl of F. Let me
just write it here so we don't

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.920
have to walk all the way
back over there.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:04.030
So F is 2z, x, y.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.270
So curl of F--

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.950
OK, you should have
lots of experience

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.500
computing curls by now--

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.330
is going to be--

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.400
I always think of it as these
little 2 by 2 determinants

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.230
with the partial derivatives in
them, but most of those are

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.360
going to be 0.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.480
We've got a dx x term that's
coming up in k, and a dy y

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.250
term that's coming up in i,
and a dz 2z term that's

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.520
coming up in j.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.970
So OK.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.370
So almost half the
terms are 0.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.160
The others are really
easy to compute.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.320
I trust that you can also
compute and get that the curl

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.300
is 1, 2, 1 here.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.120
OK, so this is F. This
is curl of F. Great.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.390
So OK.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.260
So that's curl of F.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.390
So now we need n.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.000
Well, let's think.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.880
So we need the unit normal
to our surface.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.580
So back at the beginning before
we started, we said it

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.780
was the outward-pointing
normal.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.460
So we need the outward-pointing
normal.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.360
Well, this is a sphere, right?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.790
So the normal is parallel
to the position vector.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.520
So that means n should
be parallel to the

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.850
vector x, y, z.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.620
So n should be parallel to this
vector x, y, z, but in

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.590
fact, we're even better
than that.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.380
We're on a unit sphere.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.230
So the position vector
has length of 1.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.490
So n should be pointing in the
same direction as this vector,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.610
and they both have length 1, so
they had better be equal to

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.460
each other.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.520
Great.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.130
So this unit normal n is
just this very simple

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.570
vector x, y, z.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.330
If it had been a bigger sphere,
then you would have to

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.910
divide this by the radius to
scale it appropriately.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.280
All right.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.770
So we've got curl
F. We've got n.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:02.420
So the integral that we want is
this double integral over

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.400
the surface of curl F dot n.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:14.290
So that's x plus 2y plus z, with
respect to surface area.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.840
OK.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.790
Well, now we've just got
a surface integral.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.800
It's over a hemisphere.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.990
Not a terrible thing
to parametrize.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.740
So that's what we should do.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.250
We should go in, we should
parametrize it, and then we

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.280
should just compute it like
a surface integral, like

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.140
we know how to do.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.830
So before we start though,
I want to make one little

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.640
observation.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.430
Well, maybe two little
observations.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.370
We can simplify this.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.040
All right?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.180
x.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.880
We're integrating x over the
surface of a hemisphere

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.820
centered at the origin.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.150
This hemisphere is
really symmetric.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.090
And on the back side-- the part
where x is negative--

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.690
we're getting negative
contributions from x.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.170
And on the front side--
where x is positive--

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.310
we're getting positive
contributions from x.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.250
And because this sphere is
totally symmetric, those just

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.440
cancel out completely.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:13.380
So when we integrate x over the
whole hemisphere, it just

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.060
kills itself.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.710
I mean, the negative parts
kill the positive parts.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.880
We just get 0.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.430
Similarly, this hemisphere is
symmetric between its left

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.510
side and its right side, and
so the parts where y are

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.530
negative cancel out exactly the

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.770
parts where y are positive.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.430
So as a simplifying step, we
can realize right at the

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.190
beginning, that this is actually
just the integral

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.040
over S of z with respect
to surface area.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.350
Now, if you didn't realize
that, that's OK.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.180
What you would have done is
you would have done the

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.280
parametrization that
we're about to do.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.220
And in doing that
parametrization, you would

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.320
have found that you were
integrating something like

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.600
cosine theta between 0 and 2
pi, or something like this.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.110
And that would have
given you 0.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:02.090
So you would have found this
symmetry even if you don't

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.290
realize it right now.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.030
You would have found it in the
process of computing this

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.410
integral, but it's a little
bit easier on us if we can

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.910
recognize that symmetry first.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.960
Now, notice that z doesn't
cancel, because this is just

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.930
the top hemisphere, so it
doesn't have a bottom half to

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.030
cancel out with.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.250
Right?

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.930
So the z part we can't use
this easy analysis on.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.400
If we integrated this z over
the whole sphere--

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.450
if we had the other half of the
sphere-- well, then that

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.550
would also give us 0.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.980
But we only have the top
half of the sphere.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.315
So it's going to give us
something positive, because z

00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:35.940
is always positive up there.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.470
OK, so let's actually set
about parametrizing it.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.800
We want to parametrize
the unit sphere.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.440
Well, OK.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.830
So we have our standard
parametrization that comes

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.220
from spherical coordinates.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.120
So rho is just 1.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.370
Right?

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.500
You know what?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.610
I always get a little confused,
so I'm just going to

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.320
check carefully that I'm doing
this perfectly right.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.660
x is going to be cosine
theta sine phi.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.520
Good.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.370
y is going to be sine
theta sine phi.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:20.250
And z is going to
be cosine phi.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.140
So that's our parametrization.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.240
But we need bounds, of course,
on theta and phi in order to

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.470
properly describe just
this hemisphere.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.000
So let's think.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.430
So for phi, we want the
hemisphere that goes from the

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.200
z-axis down to the xy plane.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.130
So that means we want 0 to be
less than or equal to phi to

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.150
be less than or equal
to pi over 2.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.430
Right?

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.650
That will give us just
that top half.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.760
And we want the whole thing.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.060
We want to go all
the way around.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.510
So we want 0 less than or equal
to theta less than or

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.970
equal to 2 pi.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.760
OK, so this is what
x, y, and z are.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.320
These are the bounds for our
parameters phi and theta.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.290
Now, the only other thing
we need is we need to

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.150
know what dS is.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.340
So in spherical coordinates,
we know that dS--

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.420
I'll put it right above here--

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:26.530
so dS is equal to sine
phi d phi d theta.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.080
Let me again just double-check
that I'm not

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.330
doing anything silly.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:39.120
So dS is equal to sine
phi d phi d theta.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.750
So we've got our
parametrization.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.450
We've got our bounds
on our parameters.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.980
We know what dS is.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.750
And we have the integral that
we want to compute.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.450
So now we just have to
substitute everything in and

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.760
actually compute it as
an iterated integral.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.380
Great.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.420
So let's do that.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.870
So, this integral that we want,
I'm going to write a big

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.870
equal sign that's going to carry
me all the way up here.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.380
That's an equal sign.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.580
All right.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.565
So our integral.

00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:08.010
The integral over S of z with
respect to surface area.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.700
So z becomes cosine phi.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.100
So we've got our
double integral

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.070
becomes an iterated integral.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.670
z becomes cosine phi.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.940
dS becomes sine phi
d phi d theta.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.430
And our bounds.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.720
So let's see: phi we said is
going from 0 to pi over 2.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:46.480
And theta is going
from 0 to 2 pi.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.200
OK.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.560
So now we just have a nice,
straightforward iterated

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.750
integral here to compute.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.282
So let's do the inner one first.
So we're computing.

00:14:56.282 --> 00:15:02.340
The inner integral is the
integral from 0 to pi over 2,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.050
of cosine phi sine phi d phi.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.500
And OK.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.770
So there are a bunch
of different ways

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.060
you could do this.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.500
If you wanted to get fancy, you
could do a double-angle

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.040
formula here, but that's
really more

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.880
fancy than you need.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.510
Because this is like sine phi
times d sine phi, right?

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.550
Another way of saying that is
you can make the substitution

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.990
u equals sine phi.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.470
Anyhow, this is all CALC I stuff
that hopefully you're

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.650
pretty familiar with.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.050
So OK.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.660
So this is equal to--

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.670
in the end-- we get sine squared
phi over 2, between 0

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.310
and pi over 2.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.520
OK.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.280
So we plug this in.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.660
So sine squared pi over
2, that's 1/2, minus--

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.280
sine squared 0 over
2 is 0 over 2.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.200
So it's just 1/2.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.180
So the inner integral is 1/2.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.906
So let's see about
the outer one.

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:05.410
The outer integral is just the
integral from 0 to 2 pi d

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.100
theta of whatever the
inner integral was.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.370
Well, the inner integral
was 1/2.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.660
So the integral from 0
to 2 pi of 1/2 is pi.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.650
Straightforward.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.000
Good.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.490
So OK.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.490
So that's what the surface
integral gives us.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.090
So let's go back here
and compare.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:28.530
So way back at the beginning of
this recitation, we did the

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.170
line integral for this circle
that's the boundary of this

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.360
hemisphere, and we got pi.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.850
And just now what we did is we
had the surface integral--

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.650
the associated surface integral
that we get from

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.570
Stoke's Theorem-- this
curl F dot n dS.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.320
So we computed F and
curl F and n.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.580
And then we'd noticed a little
nice symmetry here.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.070
Although if you didn't notice
it, you should have had no

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.180
trouble computing the extra
terms in the integral that you

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.240
actually ended up with it.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.680
It would've been another couple
of trig terms there

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.230
after you made the
substitution.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.320
So we parametrized our
surface nicely.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.650
Because it's a sphere,
it's easy to do.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.510
And then we computed the double
integral and we also

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.780
came out with pi.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.970
And we had better of also come
out with pi, because Stoke's

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.990
Theorem tells us that the line
integral and the surface

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.670
integral have to give
us the same value.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.290
So that's great.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.790
So that's exactly what we were
hoping would happen.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.060
And now we've sort of
convinced ourselves,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.010
hopefully, that through an
example now, we have a feel

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.766
for what sorts of things Stoke's
Theorem can do for us.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:32.016
I'll end there.
