JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,950
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,390
In lecture, you've
begun learning

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,940
about various different
ways to describe planes

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,380
in three-dimensional space.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,310
In particular, there
are equations and ways

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,830
you can translate between
other characterizations.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,830
So I have here four
different planes for you,

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,570
described in four
different ways,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,640
and what I'd like you to
do is try and figure out

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,210
what the equations for each
of these four planes are.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,730
So let me see what they are.

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,570
So we've got the
first one-- part

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,510
a-- we have a plane where I'm
giving you its normal vector

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,119
N, which is the
vector [1, 2,  3].

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,910
And I'm going to tell
you that the plane is

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,570
passing through the
point 1, 0, minus 1.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,820
In part b, I'm telling
you that the plane passes

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,450
through the origin, and
also that it's parallel

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,210
to two vectors.

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,900
It's parallel to the vector 1,
0, minus 1, and to the vector

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,510
minus 1, 2, 0.

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,200
In part c, I'm telling
you that a plane

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,370
passes through the points (1,
2, 0), (3, 1, 1), and (2, 0, 0).

25
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,540
And in part d, I'm telling
you that the plane is parallel

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,550
to the plane in part a,
and also that it passes

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,770
through the point (1, 2, 3).

28
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,430
So what I'd like you to do is
try, for each of these four

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,550
descriptions, figure
out what the equation

30
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,600
of the associated plane is.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,980
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes,

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,840
work those all out, come
back, and we can work them out

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,340
together.

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,830
So hopefully you had some luck
working on these problems.

35
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,850
Let's get started.

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,670
So we may as well start
with the first one.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,590
So in part a, we're given
that the normal vector

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,480
N is the vector i plus
2j plus 3k, or [1, 2, 3],

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,240
and that it passes through
the point P-- which I'm going

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,370
to call P-- 1, 0, minus 1.

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,180
So this is a form you
learned in lecture.

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,850
And so it's pretty
straightforward

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,530
to write down the equation here.

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,940
The thing to remember is
that if a point (x, y, z)

45
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,890
is on the plane, then we have
to have that the vector N--

46
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,380
the normal-- is
orthogonal to the vector

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,370
connecting the point (x,
y, z) to the point we know.

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,310
So that's the vector
x minus 1, y minus 0--

49
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,950
which is just y-- z plus 1.

50
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,800
So N and this vector
that lies in the plane

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,010
have to be orthogonal, so
their dot product has to be 0.

52
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,640
And now you just
multiply this out.

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,950
So in our case--
so N is [1, 2,  3],

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,800
and you take the dot product
with x minus 1, y, z,

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,300
and you get 1 times x minus
1, plus 2 times y, plus 3

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,710
times z plus 1, equals 0.

57
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,390
So that's the
equation of the plane.

58
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,640
You could also rewrite this
a bunch of different ways.

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,050
For example, you could
multiply through and collect

60
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,340
all the constants together.

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,780
So you could write this as
x plus 2y plus 3z-- and then

62
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,640
we've got a minus 1 plus 3,
so that's plus 2-- equals 0.

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,390
So these are two
different possible forms

64
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,140
for that equation.

65
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,515
And you can-- you
know, sometimes

66
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,993
people write the constant
over on this side instead

67
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:16,993
of leaving 0 over there.

68
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:17,450
All right.

69
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,640
So several different,
equivalent ways to rewrite it.

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,430
All right.

71
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,560
So there's the
equation for part a.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Now let's take a look at part b.

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,260
So for part b we have--
let's go just back

74
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,340
and remind ourselves what
the question was-- so

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,000
we have a plane that
passes through the origin.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
So we know a point
on the plane, and we

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,900
know that it's parallel to
the two vectors 1, 0, minus 1,

78
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,611
and minus 1, 2, 0.

79
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,110
OK.

80
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,940
So we've got a point and we
have two direction vectors.

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,560
And so that definitely
describes a plane for us,

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,170
as long as the two
directions aren't parallel,

83
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,607
which they aren't in this case.

84
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,440
So the question is how
do we figure out what

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,380
the equation for that plane is?

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,300
Well, we have this nice
way of figuring out

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,800
equations for planes when we
know a point and a normal.

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,880
And we know a point,
so what would be great

89
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,181
is if we could come up with a
normal direction to this plane.

90
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:08,680
So OK.

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,050
So we have two
vectors in the plane,

92
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,790
and we want to find
a vector that's

93
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,330
perpendicular to the plane.

94
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,010
Well, we have a nice
tool when you're

95
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,080
given two vectors to figure out
a vector perpendicular to both

96
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,020
of them, and that's to
take the cross product.

97
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,590
So our normal vector should be
the cross product of these two

98
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,350
vectors, or, you know,
any multiple of it

99
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,190
would do as well.

100
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:39,170
So for part b, the normal N
should be the cross product

101
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,930
of the two vectors
that are in the plane,

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,150
so it should be the cross
product of 1, 0, minus 1,

103
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,370
and-- what's the other
one-- minus 1, 2, 0.

104
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,450
So, all right, so we
just have to compute

105
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,360
what that cross product is.

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:07,430
So this is a determinant
whose first row

107
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,560
is i, j, k, and whose
second and third rows are

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
the two vectors we're crossing.

109
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,990
And OK, so we can
expand this out.

110
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,930
So, if you like, so this
is i-- the coordinate of i

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,795
is going to be 0 minus
minus 2, so that's 2.

112
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,710
The coordinate of
j is going to be

113
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,530
the negative of the determinant
of this minor, which is

114
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,015
0 minus minus 1 times minus 1.

115
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:34,470
So the determinant of
the minor is minus 1,

116
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,620
so the coordinate of j
is going to be plus 1.

117
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,370
And the coordinate of
k is the determinant

118
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,060
of this minor, which is just 2.

119
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,380
So the normal vector in this
case is the vector [2, 1, 2].

120
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,130
So OK.

121
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,589
So now we've got a normal
vector and we have a point.

122
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,880
We were given that the plane
passes through the origin.

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,719
So the equation--
using the same idea

124
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:01,885
as in the previous question.

125
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,050
So the origin is just [0, 0, 0].

126
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,850
That's a nice point to
know it passes through.

127
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,420
So the equation is just 2x
plus y plus 2z is equal to 0.

128
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,440
So this is the
equation in part b.

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,940
All right.

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,630
So part c, we're
given that the plane

131
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,950
passes through three points.

132
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,650
So once again, three points.

133
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,240
So we have a point
in particular.

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,520
We have three of them.

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,430
And so what we need then
to get to the equation

136
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,560
is we need a normal.

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
And we saw in part
b that we could

138
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,120
get a normal if we knew two
vectors that lay in the plane.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,250
So in this case, we
have three points.

140
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,210
So what we'd like is to find two
vectors that lie in the plane,

141
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,970
and then use those two vectors
to come up with a normal

142
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,820
to the plane.

143
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,260
So in our case that's
particularly-- well,

144
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,970
in any case, that's
not that hard.

145
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,650
You have three points, right?

146
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,880
So you have three points
somewhere, P, Q, and R.

147
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,459
And so if you want to know
two vectors in the same plane

148
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,250
as these three points,
well, you could just

149
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,460
take the vectors that
connect one of the points

150
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,200
to two of others, for example.

151
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:24,460
So in our case, the
plane-- since the plane

152
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:34,150
passes through the points
(1, 2, 0), and (3, 1, 1),

153
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,450
and-- what's the
last one-- (2, 0, 0).

154
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,640
So the plane is
parallel to-- well, it

155
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,230
doesn't matter
which one we choose,

156
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,460
so for example, we can
say the vector that

157
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,960
goes from here to here, so we
take this and subtract that

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,890
from it, so that would give us,
for example-- 2, minus 1, 1.

159
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,800
And we could say the vector from
here to here, so we take this

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,890
and subtract that from it.

161
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:12,270
And that will give
us 1, minus 2, 0.

162
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,130
So from three points we
could get two vectors

163
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,580
that are parallel to the plane.

164
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,070
And we have a choice
of a point to use.

165
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,850
We could use, for example,
the same point, (1, 2, 0),

166
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,665
as our base point.

167
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,040
And so then we
can go back and do

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,830
exactly what we did in part b.

169
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,650
So with those two vectors, you
can take their cross product,

170
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,290
and find a normal
vector to the plane.

171
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,790
So I'm not going
to do that for you.

172
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,650
I'll leave that for
you as an exercise.

173
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,270
Finally, in part
d, we have a plane

174
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,330
that's parallel to
the plane in part a,

175
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,950
and passes through (1, 2, 3).

176
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,080
The point (1, 2, 3).

177
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,100
So let me just rewrite
over here, parallel

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,730
to-- so the plane in
part a had equation

179
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:07,930
x plus 2y plus 3z
plus 2 equals 0,

180
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,400
and passing through
the point (1, 2, 3).

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:13,966
All right.

182
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,590
So this is the
information that we know

183
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,100
about our plane in this case.

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,060
We know that it's parallel to
the plane with this equation,

185
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,840
and that it passes through
the point (1, 2, 3).

186
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,410
Well, it's parallel
to this plane.

187
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,290
Two planes are parallel
exactly when they

188
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,390
have the same normal vector.

189
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,670
So remember that the
normal vector here

190
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,070
is always going to be encoded by
these coefficients of x, y, z.

191
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,110
In part a, this plane had
normal vector [1, 2, 3],

192
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,260
and that [1, 2, 3] shows
up in the coefficient

193
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,800
of x, coefficient of y,
and coefficient of z, which

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,400
are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,820
So to get parallel planes when
you have the equation already,

196
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,870
one thing you could do
is you can just say, oh,

197
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,720
so that just means I leave
these coefficients the same,

198
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,950
and I have to
change the constant.

199
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,240
Another thing you could do
is you could just go back

200
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,614
to our definition and say,
OK, so we know that the normal

201
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:07,880
vector is [1, 2, 3]--
the vector [1, 2, 3]--

202
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,730
and that it passes through
the point (1, 2, 3).

203
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,730
Either of these two
methods will work.

204
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,690
So let me describe,
let me show you

205
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,960
what this second, this
new method I mentioned is.

206
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,410
So we know that the
equation of the plane

207
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:29,970
has to be x plus 2y
plus 3z plus something--

208
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,710
that's a big question
mark there-- equal to 0.

209
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,620
We know that the
equation of the plane

210
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,079
is going to have
to look like this.

211
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,661
Because it has the
same normal vector,

212
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,300
it has to be parallel
to this plane.

213
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,883
And so then we just
need to figure out

214
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:46,370
what goes into this
box in order to make

215
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,340
this the equation
of the right plane.

216
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,680
Well, what else do we know?

217
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,490
We know that it passes
through the point (1, 2, 3).

218
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,650
So when we put in 1 for
x, 2 for y, and 3 for z,

219
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,190
this equation has to be true.

220
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,620
This point (1, 2, 3) has to be
a solution to this equation.

221
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,030
So when we put in
1, 2, and 3, we

222
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,750
have to have that 1, plus
2 times 2, plus 3 times

223
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,280
3, plus that same question
mark, is equal to 0.

224
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,520
Well, this part is 1
plus 4 plus 9 is 14,

225
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,230
so 14 plus whatever goes in
here has to be equal to 0,

226
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,090
so this better be
equal to negative 14.

227
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,590
Negative 14.

228
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,970
So the equation for
the plane in that case

229
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,210
is exactly x plus 2y plus
3z minus 14 equals 0.

230
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,360
Now, if you didn't like that
method, the other thing you can

231
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,090
do-- which I said
before, let me just

232
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,150
repeat it-- is that since
it's parallel to this plane,

233
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,890
it has the same normal vector.

234
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,550
And we knew that the
normal vector to this plane

235
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,740
was [1, 2, 3].

236
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,500
So you have a normal vector--
the vector [1, 2, 3]--

237
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,720
and you have a point--
the point (1, 2, 3)--

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,190
and so you can just use the
usual process given a point

239
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,570
and a normal vector.

240
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,800
So just to recap, we had four
different characterizations

241
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,380
of a plane.

242
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,390
We had a plane given in terms
of its normal vector and a point

243
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,470
that it contains.

244
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,580
We had a plane given
in terms of a point

245
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,300
and two vectors parallel to it.

246
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,270
We had a plane given in
terms of three points on it.

247
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,470
And we had a plane given
in terms of a point

248
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,570
and of another plane
parallel to it.

249
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,960
So we have-- in all
these different cases,

250
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,760
we can apply different
methods to compute

251
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,150
the equation of our plane.

252
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,530
So in the first case, we just
do this very straightforward

253
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,010
computation that you
saw in lecture here.

254
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,850
Where you just realize
that the normal vector has

255
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,010
to be orthogonal to the
vector lying in the plane.

256
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,010
So you take their dot
product and that gives you

257
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,710
the equation right away.

258
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,215
In the second
case, where you had

259
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:49,380
two parallel vector-- or
sorry, yeah, two parallel

260
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,840
vectors to the
plane, two vectors

261
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,364
lying in the plane-- you need
to come up with a normal.

262
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,780
And you can always come up
with a normal by taking a cross

263
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,170
product of those two vectors,
as long as you're careful.

264
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,460
If you accidentally chose
your two vectors parallel

265
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,490
to each other,
that wouldn't work.

266
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,610
You'd just get 0 here,
and that's no good.

267
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,000
But, so you have to choose
two non-parallel vectors

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,380
in the plane in order
to make this work.

269
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,340
In the third case,
you have three points.

270
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,310
And so with three points
what you can do is you

271
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,440
can choose two
vectors connecting

272
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,510
some of those points.

273
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,290
And that gives you two
vectors that lie in the plane,

274
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,830
and that reduces to the
case of the previous part,

275
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,750
and then again, you can
take a cross product

276
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,050
to get a normal vector.

277
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,450
Finally, we did
this fourth problem

278
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,570
where we were given a
plane parallel to it.

279
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,620
And so you can read
off the normal vector

280
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,380
from the coefficients of x,
y, and z in the equation.

281
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,770
And then either use
the very first method

282
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,480
with a point and
normal vector, or just

283
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,320
realize that you just have
to find the appropriate value

284
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,400
of the constant so that
this point actually

285
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,550
lies on the plane.

286
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,397
So I'll end there.
