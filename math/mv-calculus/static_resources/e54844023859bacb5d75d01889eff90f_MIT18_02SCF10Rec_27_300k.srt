JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,180
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,950
In lecture, you've learned
about gradients and about

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,170
directional derivatives.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,700
So I have a problem here to
test your understanding of

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,820
those objects and give you some
practice computing them.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,060
So I have three functions
here.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,410
And for each function,
I've given you

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,260
a point and a direction.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,990
So what I'd like you to do is
compute the gradients of the

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,900
functions, then evaluate their
gradients at the point given,

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,100
and then compute the directional
derivative of the

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,250
function at the point in the
direction of the vector given.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,860
So here, for example, in part a,
I've given you the function

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,650
f of x, y equal to x squared y
plus xy squared, at the point

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,005
x equal minus 1, y equal 2, and
in the direction of the

18
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,400
vector 3, 4.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,130
And then we've got two more
examples here. g of x, y, z is

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,390
equal to the square root of x
squared plus y squared plus z

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,920
squared, P is the point 2,
6, minus 3, and v is the

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,480
direction 1, 1, 1.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,870
And our third example, h is a
function of four variables, w,

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,220
x, y, and z.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:19,350
It's given by wx plus wy plus wz
plus xy plus xz plus yz, at

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,550
the point 2, 0, minus 1, minus
1, in the direction 1, minus

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,030
1, 1, minus 1.

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,740
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,040
out these three problems,
come back, and we can

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,290
work them out together.

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:40,350

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,760
I hope you had some luck working
out these problems.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Let's get started on
the first one.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,820
So on the first one, our
function f of x, y is equal to

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,330
x squared y plus xy squared.

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,200
So to compute the gradient, I
just have to compute the first

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,220
partials of our function,
and then put them

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,570
into a single vector.

39
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,910
So that's what the
gradient is.

40
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,650
So we have that the gradient
of f at x, y is

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,760
equal to the vector.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,290
And its first component is the
first partial of f with

43
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,270
respect to x, so that's going
to be 2xy plus y squared.

44
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,820
And its second component is the
partial of f with respect

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,920
to y, so that's going to
be x squared plus 2xy.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
So this is the gradient
of our function f.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,140
Now, the question asked you to
compute this gradient at the

48
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,620
particular point minus 1, 2.

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,870
So we have gradient of f at the
point minus 1, 2 is equal

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,740
to-- well, we just put in x
equal minus 1, y equal 2 into

51
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,310
this formula.

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,060
So at x equal minus 1, y equals
2, this is 2 times

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,480
minus 1 times 2 plus
2 squared.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,260
So that's minus 4 plus
4, so that's just 0.

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,750
And the second term is minus
1 squared plus 2 times

56
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,180
minus 1 times 2.

57
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,980
So that's 1 plus 4-- nope--

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,510
1 plus negative 4, so
that's negative 3.

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:14,890
All right.

60
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,650
So this is the gradient
of our function f.

61
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,820
This is the gradient at
the point minus 1, 2.

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,950
Now we are asked for the
directional derivative.

63
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,240
So we were asked for the
directional derivative of f in

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,355
a direction.

65
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:34,400
So we're given, I didn't give
you, I gave you a vector v.

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,820
But when we take directional
derivatives, what we want is a

67
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,450
unit vector.

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,020
Right?

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,280
So the vector v that
I gave you--

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,790
was right over here--

71
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,820
it was this vector 3, 4.

72
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,380
And so we need to find the unit
vector u in the direction

73
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,750
of v in order to apply
our usual formula.

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:01,890
So u is just v divided by the
length of v. So in this case,

75
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,140
the vector 3, 4, by the
Pythagorean theorem,

76
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,450
it has length 5.

77
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:14,110
So this is equal to the
vector 3/5 comma 4/5.

78
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,700
And so our directional
derivative in the

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,270
direction of v--

80
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,980
which is this vector u--

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,210
it's just equal to the gradient
at that point dotted

82
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,690
with the direction vector.

83
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,990
So this is equal to gradient
of f at that point dot u.

84
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,560
Which in our case
is equal to--

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,000
well, since we're interested
at the point P--

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,020
it's equal to 0, minus
3, dot our vector u,

87
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,650
which is 3/5, 4/5.

88
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,680
And that dot product
is negative 12/5.

89
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,850
So in this direction, the
function is decreasing at

90
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,490
about this rate at
the given point.

91
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,870
All right.

92
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,050
That's part a.

93
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,340
Let's go on to part b.

94
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,380
So, you know, you've probably
noticed that these questions

95
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,410
are all fairly similar.

96
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,100
The only real complication is
that I've been increasing the

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,200
number of variables.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,490
But of course, you know how to
take a gradient for a function

99
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,010
of three variables as well.

100
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,720
So in this case, our function
g of x, y, z is given by the

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,330
square root of x squared plus
y squared plus z squared.

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,920
So, if you like, this is the
function that measures the

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,890
distance of a point
from the origin.

104
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,650
And so we're asked first
for the gradient, so

105
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,146
the gradient of g.

106
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:45,550

107
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,040
What do I do?

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,020
Well, again, I just take these
partial derivatives.

109
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,100
This is going to be a tiny
bit messy, I'm afraid.

110
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,090
Because I take a partial
derivative of this expression

111
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,980
with respect to x, I've got to
apply the chain rule, right?

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,600
Because this is a composition
of functions here.

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,050
So OK.

114
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,580
So, what do I get?

115
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,720
I get the derivative of
the inside times the

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,660
derivative of the out.

117
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,720
So the outside function
is a square root, so

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,470
that's to the 1/2 power.

119
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:19,165
So I get 1/2 times the thing
inside to the minus 1/2 power.

120
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:23,090
So it's over 2, times the square
root of x squared plus

121
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,160
y squared plus z squared.

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,845
And then I need to multiply by
the derivative of the inside,

123
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,160
which is times 2x.

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,650
OK.

125
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,960
So, and then the 2's cancel, and
that's x over square root

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,880
of x squared plus y squared
plus z squared.

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,536
And similarly, this is a nice
symmetric function, and, you

128
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,200
know, if I changed x and
y, it's the same.

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,770
So the other partial derivatives
look very similar.

130
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,970
So they're going to be y over
the square root of x squared

131
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,730
plus y squared plus z squared.

132
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,040
And z over the square root
of x squared plus y

133
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,930
squared plus z squared.

134
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,310
Sorry.

135
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,090
That's a little bit of
a long formula there.

136
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,334
But there we have it.

137
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,584
That's the derivative-- or,
sorry, not the derivative.

138
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,230

139
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,190
That's the gradient.

140
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,100
The vector of partial
derivatives.

141
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,900
So now you were asked also to
compute this gradient at a

142
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,611
particular point.

143
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:18,861
So the point in question--

144
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,200

145
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,020
I have to look back over here.

146
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,220
And the point in question was
this point 2, 6, minus 3.

147
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,750
So at the point 2, 6,
minus 3, we want

148
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,570
to compute the gradient.

149
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,010
So we just take these numbers
back over to our formula over

150
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,570
there, and we're going
to put them in.

151
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,940
So we take the gradient
of g at 2, 6, minus 3.

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,850
Well, OK, so this square root
of x squared plus y squared

153
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,240
plus z squared appears in all
terms. So let's compute that

154
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,610
first.

155
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,370
So x squared is 4, y squared
is 36, and z squared is 9.

156
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,910
So I add those numbers
together, I get 49.

157
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,600
And then I take a square root
of that and I get 7.

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,790
So these denominators are all
going to be 7, and then up top

159
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,820
I just have x, y, and z.

160
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,840
So this is going to be 2 over
7 comma 6 over 7 comma

161
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,640
minus 3 over 7.

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,330
All right.

163
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,030
So just what I get by plugging
the values at our point into

164
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,630
this formula.

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,890
So this is the gradient
at that point.

166
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,540
And now once again, I want
to compute a particular

167
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,770
directional derivative
of this function.

168
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,740
So in order to do that, I just
need the right unit factor,

169
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,000
and I need to dot it.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,850
So the direction that I asked
you was the direction v with

171
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,380
coordinates 1, 1, 1.

172
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,340
So of course again, this
isn't a unit vector.

173
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,410
So we need to divide it by its
length to find the unit vector

174
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,740
that we're going to use.

175
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,520
So the length of this vector
is the square root of 1

176
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
squared plus 1 squared plus
1 squared, so that's the

177
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,950
square root of 3.

178
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,620
So u is equal to--

179
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,000
well, I'm just going
to write it as--

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,970
1 over the square root of 3
times the vector 1, 1, 1.

181
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,410

182
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:20,710
And so the directional
derivative dg ds in the

183
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,500
direction u hat is-- again,
it's what I get, I dot the

184
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,660
gradient with this u--

185
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,620
it's gradient dot u.

186
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,830
Which in our case, so that one
over the square root of 3

187
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,080
lives out front.

188
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,240

189
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,730
And now I dot 2/7, 6/7, minus
3/7 with 1, 1, 1.

190
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:55,350
And that's just going to give
me 2/7 plus 6/7 minus 3/7.

191
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,550
And OK, so we can finish off
the arithmetic there, and I

192
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,800
think that's 5, over 7
square root of 3 if I

193
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,550
didn't make any mistake.

194
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,960
Now, the last one, very,
very similar.

195
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,880
Now we have a function
of four variables.

196
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,060
There's really nothing
new there at all.

197
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,320
So let me rewrite,
so for part c.

198
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:26,830
We have h of w, x, y, z is equal
to wx plus wy plus wz

199
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:34,060
plus xy plus xz plus yz.

200
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:41,800
So, for the gradient of h, I
just take the four partial

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,190
derivatives.

202
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,940
Now here, w is first. So I take
the partial derivative

203
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,460
with respect to w as the
first coordinate.

204
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,260
So that's going to be
x plus y plus z.

205
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,740
And then I take the partial
derivative with respect to x

206
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,080
as the second coordinate.

207
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,845
So that's going to be
w plus y plus z.

208
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:10,690
And similarly, the last two
are w plus x plus z, and w

209
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,670
plus-- that's a plus--

210
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,330
x plus y.

211
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,770
Whew.

212
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,110
OK.

213
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,760
So that's my gradient.

214
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,260
Those are my partial
derivatives.

215
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,560
Now, I asked you again
for the gradient at

216
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,620
a particular point.

217
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,690
So that's grad h at the point
2, 0, minus 1, minus 1.

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,200
So we can just plug that in.

219
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,330
Here, it's 0 plus minus 1
plus minus 1 is minus 2.

220
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,290
Here it's 2 plus minus 1
plus minus 1, that's 0.

221
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,660
Here, it's 2 plus 0 plus
minus 1 so that's 1.

222
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,560
And lastly, it's 2 plus
0 plus minus 1 is 1.

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,360
So that's the gradient of this
function h at this point P.

224
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
And now I gave you again, I gave
you a vector v. So this

225
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,900
was the vector 1, minus
1, 1, minus 1.

226
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,530
And I asked you to find the
directional derivative at this

227
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,930
point in that direction.

228
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,770
Again, we need a unit vector.

229
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,260
This isn't a unit vector.

230
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:22,110
So u is equal to v over the
length of v. Well, what is the

231
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,470
length of v in this case?

232
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,860
It's over the square root of--

233
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,980

234
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,220
well, we square the coordinates
and add them.

235
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,305
So that's 1 plus 1
plus 1 plus 1.

236
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:35,520
So that's 4: square
rooted is 2.

237
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,970
So that's v over 2.

238
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,330

239
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:47,510
And finally, I get that the
directional derivative dh ds

240
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:53,480
in this direction u, is what I
get when I dot this gradient

241
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,340
together with the direction
in which I'm heading.

242
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,160
So this is minus 2, 0, 1, 1.

243
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,330
The gradient dotted with the
unit vector of the direction.

244
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,060

245
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,500
Which we just computed.

246
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,710
And so finally, you could expand
this out yourself.

247
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,520
I won't right down the final
answer, but it's just a dot

248
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,610
product, right?

249
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,180
All right.

250
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,630
So hopefully this has gotten you
totally comfortable with

251
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,010
computing gradients and with
computing directional

252
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,920
derivatives from gradients.

253
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,980
So I'll end there.

254
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,080
