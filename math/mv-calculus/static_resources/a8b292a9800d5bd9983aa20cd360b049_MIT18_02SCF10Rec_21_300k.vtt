CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.830
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.130
that has to do with tangent
planes and approximations.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.740
So we know that a rectangle--
we'll say a rectangle has

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.250
sides x and y, and we know that
to find the area of the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.790
rectangle then, we just take x
times y, and I would like us

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.100
to approximate the area
for x equal to 2.1

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.020
and y equal to 2.8.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.940
And obviously, with this type of
equation, it's not hard to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.060
just compute this, but I'd like
us to use the tangent

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.980
plane approximation to determine
the value, and then

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.860
we'll compare it to the actual
value, just to give us an idea

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.960
of how we can use the tangent
plane to approximate things.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.790
And obviously, I'd like to
do this near x equal

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.060
2 and y equal 3.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.690
So when you're doing your
tangent plane approximation,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.030
do the approximation at x
equal 2 and y equal 3.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.190
And then when you're done with
that, I would like you to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.040
answer this question.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.530
So near x equal 2 and
y equal 3, which

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.980
has the greater effect?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.050
A change in x or an
equal change in y?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.870
So if I change by x in the same
value as I change by y,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.490
which will have the
greater impact?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.770
So why don't you pause the tape,
work on the problems,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.850
and when you're ready to see how
I do them, bring it back

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.842
up, and I'll come back
and show you.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.030
OK, welcome back.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.980
So we're going to work on this
problem, and as I mentioned,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.560
the first thing we want to
do is do a tangent plane

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.620
approximation near x equal
2 and y equal 3.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.450
So let me write down what we're
going to need in order

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.340
to do that.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.620
First, we'll remind ourselves
that in this case, what I'm

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.720
going to approximate is the area
function for a rectangle,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.650
which is A of x, y is
equal to x times y.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.260
So that's the function I'm going
to be approximating.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.720
And now the actual
approximation, the tangent

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.620
plane approximation, has
the following form.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.010
So we know A of x, y
is approximately--

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.080
well, it's going to be the area
evaluated at the point

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.130
I'm interested in, which we
said was 2 comma 3, right,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.200
plus the x-derivative of area
evaluated at 2 comma 3 times

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.160
the change in x.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.280
And the change in x is where
x is now versus where we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.350
started, which is
at x equal 2.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.530
And then the same thing
in terms of y.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.590
So you do the y-derivative
evaluated at 2 comma 3, and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.460
then you do the change in y.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.390
And since we started at y equals
3, the change in y is y

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.020
minus 3, OK?

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.270
So now we obviously need to fill
in three quantities here.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.900
The three things we need to
evaluate: area evaluated at 2,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.880
3, its x-derivative evaluated at
2, 3, and its y-derivative

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.640
evaluated at 2, 3.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180
So let me just point
out what we have.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.680
Area evaluated at 2, 3, well,
that's just 2 times 3, which

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.740
we can do, so that's 6.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.080
That's pretty easy.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.340
Now A sub x, so the derivative
of the area function with

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.690
respect to x.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.300
The derivative of the area
function with respect

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.870
to x is just y.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.800
y in that case we treat
as a constant.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.680
We take this derivative.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620
We just get y back.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.800
And so, A sub x evaluated at 2,
3 is going to be y, which y

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.030
here is 3, so we get A sub
x is equal to 3 at 2, 3.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.150
In a similar vein, we can
immediately look and see that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.550
A sub y evaluated at 2,
3 is going to be 2.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.510
And the reason for that, of
course, is if we look back

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.920
here, the derivative of A with
respect to y is x, so

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.780
evaluating it at 2,
3 gives us 2.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.730
OK.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.930
So now we just have to
fill everything in.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.940
So my tangent plane
approximation now says I get 6

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.410
plus 3 times x minus 2 plus
2 times y minus 3.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.050
And what I wanted was the
area at 2.1 comma 2.8.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.980
So if I fill in those values for
x and y-- so 2.1 is x and

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.350
2.8 is y-- if I fill those in,
I get that this is equal to--

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.870
well, I'll keep writing

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.745
approximately just to be safe--

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:26.940
is 6 plus 3 times--

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.440
well, 2.1 minus 2 gives me a
0.1 there and 2 times 2.8

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.850
minus 3 gives me a negative 0.2
there, so I get a negative

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.440
0.4, I get a positive 0.3,
so together this

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.360
is a negative 0.1.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.940
6 minus 0.1 gives me 5.9.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.680
So the area based on
the approximation

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.840
is 5.9 square units.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.140
And, in actuality, if you
multiply it out, I think you

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.940
get something like 5.88, so
the approximation is very

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.960
good, right?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.030
We're close to 2, 3 and that is
one of the reasons we can

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.900
know it's going to be very,
it should be very good.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.430
It should be pretty good, OK?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.060
Now, I just have to answer the
second part of the question.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.470
So let me remind us what
the second part was.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.150
It was near x equal 2
and y equal 3, which

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.700
has a greater effect?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.330
A change in x or an
equal change in y?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.130
And to do that, it's really
easiest to come back and look

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.710
at maybe this line.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.160
I'll underline this
line right here.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.820
Actually, I'll box it, OK?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.580
This value will represent
the change in x.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.940
So we started at 2, and we
go somewhere, and that'll

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.370
represent the change in x.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.030
This value represents
the change in y.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.270
So if we look at which has a
greater impact near 2, 3, if

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.580
my change in x and my change in
y are equal, then obviously

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.430
this term has a bigger impact,
because there's a 3.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.300
The coefficient here is 3 and
the coefficient here is 2.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.850
And so the point is, changes
in x will have a greater

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.690
effect than changes in y.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.700
And what this corresponds to
pictorially is if we make a

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.640
slice where we keep y constant
and we look at the curve in

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.140
the xz-plane, that corresponds
to the fact that the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.160
derivative in the xz-plane of
the curve there is more

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.560
significant-- the curve there
has a steeper derivative--

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.250
than if I kept the x-value
fixed and I looked in the

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.700
yz-plane and I looked
at the curve there.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.850
So the sort of one-dimensional
picture is that the derivative

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.350
of a curve in the x-direction,
keeping y fixed, is steeper

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.460
than the derivative of the
curve in the y-direction,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.930
keeping x fixed.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.540
So maybe hopefully that wasn't
more confusing than

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.360
it should have been.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.920
From here, you can see it right
away, but that's sort of

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.160
the picture of it as well.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.760
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
