DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,740
In this problem, I'd like you to
compute the area of a triangle.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,380
This triangle sits
in space and it

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,560
has its three vertices labeled
here as P_1, P_2, and P_3.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,070
So we're going to
compute this area,

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,810
and we're going to do it
using the cross product, which

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,029
we learned about in lecture.

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,070
So why don't you take some
time to work this out,

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,400
pause the video, and we'll
check back in a minute

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,310
and see how I did it.

11
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,450
Hello and welcome back.

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,950
So the first thing that I
like to do with a problem

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,140
like this is I like to draw a
picture so I can kind of think

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,530
about what's going on.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:59,720
So we have this triangle
sitting out in space.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,890
And we know that we want to
take a cross product in order

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,866
to compute its area, but
we need to be careful.

18
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,365
Cross product, it
doesn't make sense

19
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,698
to take cross product of points.

20
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,029
What makes sense is to take
cross product of vectors.

21
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,570
So the first thing
that we need to do

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,600
is build some vectors that
describe this triangle.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:31,014
And the vectors that we need
to build are P_1P_2 and P_1P_3.

24
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,430
Since we're going to use these
in a minute, let's go ahead

25
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,960
and compute them now.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:44,700
So P_1P_2 is just the
difference of P_2 minus P_1.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,390
So we get a 0
minus a negative 1.

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,155
So we get 1, 2, and 1.

29
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,530
Let me just check my notes to
make sure I did that right.

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,210
Good.

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:04,030
And P_1P_3.

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,500
We get again 0
minus a negative 1.

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,540
So 1, we get minus
1, and then we get 1.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,120
Let me again check my notes.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,710
Very good.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,210
OK.

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,800
So now that we
have these vectors,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,180
we need to remember
that if we take

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:31,460
the absolute value of P_1P_2
cross product with P_1P_3,

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:43,960
this will be equal to the
area of the parallelogram they

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,460
enclose.

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,750
So let's get started by
computing this cross product.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,690
So P_1P_2 cross P_2P_3.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,820
So, remember, to
compute a cross product,

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,260
we take the determinant of a
matrix where we put in our unit

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,290
normal vectors i, j, and k.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,740
And then we enter in, the
remaining entries of the matrix

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,240
are just the entries
of our vectors.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,670
So we do [1, 2, 1].

50
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,750
And [1, -1, 1].

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,580
OK.

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,535
And so we can compute this.

53
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:34,910
And we get-- so the i component,
we get 2 minus a negative 1.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,740
So we get 3.

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,190
Now the j component.

56
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,590
If we look at the cofactor
matrix, it's just [1, 1; 1, 1],

57
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,210
and that has determinant 0.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,310
So our middle
component is just 0.

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,180
And finally the k component.

60
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,430
We get minus 1, minus another 2.

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,180
So altogether, we get minus 3.

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,010
So what that tells us
now is that this quantity

63
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,820
here, the magnitude
of the cross product,

64
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,190
is just 3 times the
square root of 2,

65
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,200
just looking at the length
of this vector here.

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,380
So we're almost done, but
let's go back and look

67
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,340
at what we had to start with.

68
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,150
We were interested in
the triangle over here

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,980
which was enclosed
by the vectors P_1P_2

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,470
and the vectors P_1P_3.

71
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,050
And what we just
computed is actually

72
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,210
the area of this parallelogram,
which as you can see

73
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,920
is twice the area
of the triangle

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,530
that we're actually
interested in.

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:55,540
So going back over here, we see
that the area of our triangle

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,480
is equal to 3 root
2, and we just

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,410
need to divide by 2
to get the triangle.

78
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:02,910
OK?

79
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,406
And I'll leave it at that.
