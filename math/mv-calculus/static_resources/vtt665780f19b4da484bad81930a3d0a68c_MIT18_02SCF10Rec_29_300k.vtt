JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.230
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.950
In lecture, you've been learning
about using the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.970
method of Lagrange multipliers
to optimize functions of

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.950
several variables given
a constraint.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.630
So here's a problem that you can
practice this method on.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.290
So I've got a function f of x,
y, z equals x squared plus x

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.970
plus 2y squared plus
3z squared.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.490
And what I'd like you to do is
find the maximum and minimum

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.850
values that this function takes
as the point x, y, z

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.190
moves around the unit sphere x
squared plus y squared plus z

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.720
squared equals 1.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.630
So to optimize this function
given the constraint x squared

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.435
plus y squared plus z
squared equals 1.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.890
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.970
that out, come back, and we
can work it out together.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.660
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.910
Let's have a go at it.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.100
So remember that the method
of Lagrange multipliers--

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.690
in order to apply it-- what it
says is that when you have a

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.600
function being optimized on
some constraint condition,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.520
what you do to find the points
where the function could be

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.870
maximum or minimum is that
first you look for points

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.560
where the gradient of your
objective function is parallel

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.380
to the gradient of your
constraint function.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.580
So what that means is you take
the partial derivatives fx,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.770
fy, fz, and you say fx has to
be equal to lambda times gx,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.030
fy has to be equal to lambda
times gy, and fz has to be

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.000
equal to lambda times
gz, for some lambda.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.190
And then you solve that
system together with

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.720
the constraint equation.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.960
And so the points that are the
solutions of that system of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.340
equations, those points are your
points that you have to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.570
check for whether they're the
maximum or the minimum.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.760
And also, sometimes you have
some boundary to your region

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.940
and you have to check
that as well.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.850
So in this case, the sphere
doesn't have boundary.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.670
Right?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.710
So we don't have any boundary
conditions to check.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.770
So we're going to have a really
straightforward problem

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.320
to solve where we just have
to look at the partial

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.970
derivatives.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.100
So let's write down that system
of equations that we

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.070
have to solve.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.290
So the partial derivative of f
with respect to x is going to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.810
be 2x plus 1.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.090
So we have to solve the system
2x plus 1 equals.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.457
And the partial derivative of
our constraint with respect to

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:28.660
x is 2x, so 2x plus 1 has to
equal lambda times 2x.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.700
That's what we get from the
x-partial derivatives.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.760
How about from the y-partial
derivatives?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.550
The y-partial derivative
of f is going to be 4y.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.580
So that has to be equal to
lambda and the y-partial

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.720
derivative of the constraint
equation which is 2y.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.710
And the z-partial derivative
of f is 6z.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.615
So 6z has to be equal to
lambda times, well the

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.530
z-partial derivative
of the constraint

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.780
function which is 2z.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.340
And we have the last equation x
squared plus y squared plus

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.780
z squared equals 1.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.150
So we get four equations in
our variables x, y, and z,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.750
plus this new parameter lambda
that we introduced.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.810
And we want to solve these to
find the points x, y, and z at

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.240
which these equations
are all satisfied.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.260
And then, once we get those
points, we have to test them

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.770
to see whether they
are the maximum or

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.000
the minimum or neither.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.960
So OK.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.350
So we have this system
of equations.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.720
Now, this is a little
bit complicated.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.500
It's not a system of
linear equations.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.880
So we need to think about ways
that we can solve it.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.560
And one thing that I think we
can do here, is if you look at

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.650
the second and third equations,
you see that in the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
second equation, everything
has a factor of y in it.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.980
So either y is equal to 0,
or we can divide by it.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.580
So from the second equation, we
have that either y is equal

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.420
to 0, or we can divide by y, in
which case we get lambda is

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.590
equal to 2.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.360
Similarly, from the third
equation, we have that either

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.310
z is equal to 0, or we can
divide by z and we get lambda

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.772
is equal to 3.

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:20.124
So from the third equation
we have z equals 0 or

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:21.374
lambda equals 3.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.570
So now we have a bunch of
possibilities, right?

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.720
So either we have y equals z
equals 0, or we have y equals

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.370
0 and lambda equals 3, or
we have lambda equals 2

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.980
and z equals 0.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.060
Or well, the other possibility
would be lambda equals 2 and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.800
lambda equals 3, but
that can't happen.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.490
So we have three
possibilities.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.570
Three different ways that
this could be satisfied.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.840
So let's go over here and
write down what those

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.750
possibilities are.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.820
So case one, or maybe
I'll call it case a.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.951
So the case a is when y is
equal to z is equal to 0.

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.201
So when y is equal to
z is equal to 0--

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.360
OK, we need to find x's still.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.690
So let's look back
at our equations.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.810
And when y is equal to z is
equal to 0, well we can solve

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.670
our constraint equation for x.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.220
When y equals z equals 0, we
have that x squared equals 1.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.460
So there are two
possibilities.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.410
The point 1, 0, 0, and the
point minus 1, 0, 0.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.080
So this gives us, in this case,
we have x equals 1 or x

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.160
equals minus 1.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.030
So that gives us the points 1,
0, 0, and minus 1, 0, 0 that

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.960
we're going to have to
check at the end.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.270
All right.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.080
So the second case is we could
have y equal to 0 and lambda

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.880
equal to 3.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.240
So in this case, let's go back
to our equations again.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.020
So from lambda equals 3, we
have in our first equation

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.250
that 2x plus 1 equals 6x.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.180
So 1 equals 4x or
x equals 1/4.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.600
So this implies over here
that x equals 1/4.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.510
And now, we still
need to find z.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.420
So if we go back to our
constraint equation here, we

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.400
have that x is a quarter
and y is 0.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.290
So that means 1/16 plus
z squared equals 1.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.170
So z has to be the square root
of 15/16, plus or minus.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.760
And z is equal to plus or minus,
so that we can also

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.470
write that as the square
root of 15 over 4.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.780
So this also gives us
two points to check.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.930
The points are 1/4, 0, the
square root of 15 over 4.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.520
And 1/4, 0, minus square
root of 15 over 4.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.250
And finally, we have
our third case.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.420
So our third case is when lambda
is equal to 2 and z is

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.300
equal to 0.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.810
So again, let's go back
over to our equation.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.610
So when lambda equals 2 in the
first equation, we have 2x

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.690
plus 1 equals 4x.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.930
So 2x equals 1 or x is 1/2.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.940
So this gives us x
equals a half.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.050
And now if you take z equals 0
and x equals 1/2, we can take

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.810
that down to our constraint
equation.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.620
And we get a quarter plus y
squared equals 1, so y is a

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.820
square root of 3/4.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.120
So y equals plus or minus
square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.820
And this gives us two points.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:50.230
1/2, square root
of 3 over 2, 0.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:56.580
And 1/2, minus square
root of 3 over 2, 0.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.980
Those were our three cases.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.160
We've solved each of them.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.190
We've solved each of them all
the way down to finding the

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.280
points that they lead to.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.850
Now remember, we said already
that there's no boundary to

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.400
this region.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.670
It's just the sphere.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.930
It has no edges.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.670
So these are the only points
we have to check.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.170
We have to check these
six points.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.190
What do we have to
check them for?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.400
Well, we have to look at the
value of f at each of these

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.560
six points.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.520
And we want to figure out where
f is maximized and where

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.530
f is minimized, and these six
points are the only points

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.300
where that could happen,
where f could be

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.020
maximized or minimized.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.490
So we just have to evaluate our
objective function f at

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.960
these six points and find
the largest value and

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.430
the smallest value.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.340
So let's do that.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.490
So our objective function,
remember, it's all the way

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.880
back over here.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.010
It's this function x squared
plus x plus 2y

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.210
squared plus 3z squared.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:49.570
OK.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.850
So let's look at the value of
that function at these point.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.840
So x squared plus x plus 2y
squared plus 3z squared at the

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.710
point 1, 0, that's
just equal to 2.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.540
So I'm going to write the
function values just off to

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.980
the side of the points here.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.700
So this gives me the value 2.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.450
And I'm going to circle them.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.730
So the point 1, 0, 0 gives
me the value 2.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.970
The point minus 1, 0, 0--

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.910
so that's x squared is one, plus
x is minus 1, so that's 1

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.750
minus 1 is 0, and then the
y and z terms are both 0.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.230
So at the point minus 1, 0, 0,
the function value is 0.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.360
I'm going to circle that.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.970
Oh boy.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.240
OK, so at these points--

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.920
at the point 1/4, 0, square root
of 15 over 4, and 1/4, 0,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.350
minus square root
of 15 over 4--

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.520
I'm going to cheat and look at
what I wrote down already.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.530
So you could do the arithmetic
yourself, but I think it's not

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.480
that hard to work out that in
both of these cases, the

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.510
function value that you
get out is 25 over 8.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.880
I'm not going to do the
arithmetic right now.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.830
But you can double-check
that for yourself.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.600
And at these last two points--
the points 1/2, root 3 over 2,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.180
0, and 1/2, minus root
3 over 2, 0--

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.120
the function has the same value
at both of those points.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.500
That value is 9/4.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.000
Yeah, so 25 over 8 was the value
at both of these points,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.740
and 9/4 is the value of
both of these points.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.080
So now, to find the maximum
value of the function and the

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.340
minimum value of the function,
we just look at the values

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.070
that we got and say, which of
these is biggest and which of

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:36.685
these is smallest?

00:10:36.685 --> 00:10:42.610
And in our case, it's easy to
see that 0 is the minimum.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.800
You know, all the
other values are

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.600
positive, so 0 is the minimum.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:56.740
So our minimum value of f is 0
at the point minus 1, 0, 0.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.480
And if you just compare the
values 2 and 25/8 and 9/4,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.766
25/8 is the largest. This is
bigger than 3, whereas both of

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.280
those are less than
3, for example.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.540
This is one easy way
to see that.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:20.780
So the max of f is 25/8, and
that's achieved at the points

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:28.680
1/4, 0, plus or minus square
root of 15 over 4.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.820
So there you have it.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.860
The method of Lagrange
multipliers.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:37.220
We just followed exactly the
strategy that we have.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.750
So you start out and you have
an objective function and a

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.770
constraint function.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.710
And so what do you do?

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.240
You write down their partial
derivatives and you come up

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.780
with this system of equations.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.642
So this system of equations that
you get by setting, you

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:54.430
know, fx equal to lambda gx,
fy equal to lambda gy, fz

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.270
equals lambda gz, and your
constraint equation g equals

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.940
some constant.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.310
So then the one part of this
procedure that isn't just a

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.120
recipe is that you need to
solve this system of

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.110
equations, but sometimes
that can be hard.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.020
So in this case, there were a
couple of observations that we

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.570
could make from the second and
third equations that made it

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.810
relatively straightforward
to do.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.460
And that gave us some cases.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.380
And then in each of those
cases, we were able to

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.890
completely solve for the
points x, y, and z.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.400
Now we also could solve for
the associated values of

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.380
lambda, but lambda isn't
important to us.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.690
It doesn't affect f.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.990
We can forget about it as soon
as we found it, once we found

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.320
x, y, and z.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.490
So we were able to solve.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.330
In this case, we got six points
of interest. And then

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.690
you just look at the value of
your objective function at

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.470
those points.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.280
So that was what I wrote
down in these circles.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.440
So you look at the value of
the objective function.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.810
And to find the maximum value of
the function, you just look

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.300
at which of those is largest.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.220
Now sometimes--

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.751
not in this problem, but in
other problems, you'll also

00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:57.640
have to check--

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.420
if the region has a boundary,
you'll also have to check for

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.180
possible maxima and minima on
the boundary of the region.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.160
But a sphere doesn't have
any edges, so it

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.070
doesn't have any boundary.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.020
So we don't have to
worry about that.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.770
So that's how we apply the
method of Lagrange multipliers

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.690
to this problem.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.370
And how you can apply it to
other problems as well.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.080
I'll end there.
