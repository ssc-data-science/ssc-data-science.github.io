00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.230
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.710
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.545
In lecture, you've been learning
about line integrals

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.560
of vector fields.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.090
And I have one problem here that
requires you to do two

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.080
line integrals of vector
fields on that subject.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.630
So OK.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.250
So in both problems, F is going
to be the vector field

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.070
of whose coordinates are xy and
x squared plus y squared.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
And C is going to be the arc
of the parabola y equals x

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.100
squared that starts at the point
1, 1 and ends at the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.670
point 2, 4.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.350
All right?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500
So what I'd like you to do is
to compute the integral over

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.520
this curve C of F.dr in
two different ways.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.680
So the first time, I'd like
you to use the natural

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.570
parametrization x equals
t, y equals t squared.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.950
For me, at least, that's the
first parametrization that I

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.810
think of when I think
about this curve.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.060
But I'd also like you to do
it again using a different

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.310
parametrization, using the
parametrization x equals e to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.090
the t, y equals e to the 2t.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.490
So this still parametrizes the
curve y equals x squared,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.830
since e to the t squared
equals e to the 2t.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.040
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at computing

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.750
this integral using these two
different parametrizations,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.520
come back, and we can work
it out together.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.290
So let's get started.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.740
We want to compute a line
integral of a vector field F.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.820
So we know that the integral
over our curve C of F.dr--

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.120
well, usually we write--

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.800
F equals M, N. The two
components are M and N. So in

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.400
this case, this is going to be
equal to the integral over C

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.270
of M dx plus N dy.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.700
Now, in our case, we
know what F is.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.360
We know that F is the
vector field xy, x

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.770
squared plus y squared.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.910
So this is equal to the integral
over C of xy dx, plus

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.400
x squared plus y squared dy.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000
And now we just need to plug
in for our two different

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.050
cases, into our
parametrizations, and this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500
will turn into an integral
that we can evaluate.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.050
So let's have a look-see.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.090
So in our first parametrization
over here, we

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.970
have x equals t and y
equals t squared.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.050
And we want this parametrization
to go from the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.240
points 1, 1 to the point 2, 4.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.110
So that means that t--

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.680
x--

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.260
t is going from 1 to 2.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.510
OK.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.290
So I'm going to just write
equals, and continue on.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.490
So in this first part, t is our
parameter, and it's going

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.320
from 1 to 2.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:28.400
So xy is going to be t times
t squared, and dx is dt.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.710
And then plus--

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.170
so x squared plus
y squared is--

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.000
t squared plus t
to the fourth.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.720
And dy is times 2t dt,
since y is t squared.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.430
All right.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.790
So this is our integral.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.360
And now it's straightforward
to compute.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.820
This is single variable integral
of a polynomial, so

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.900
we might have some fraction
arithmetic in our future, but

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.610
nothing horrible.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.210
So let's collect our dt's.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.520
So this is the integral
from 1 to 2.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.900
So here I've got 2t cubed
plus 2t to the fifth.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.960
And here I have t cubed.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:19.020
So that's 3t cubed plus
2t to the fifth dt.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.970
OK, and so now we have
to evaluate.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.480
So this is equal to-- let
me just continue it.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:33.630
So 3t cubed becomes 3t
to the fourth over 4.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.630
Plus 2t to the fifth becomes--

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.140
well, t to the sixth over 6--

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.470
2t to the sixth over 6, so
that's-- plus t to the sixth

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.420
over 3, between t
equals 1 and 2.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.940
And let me just bring that
computation up here.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:06.790
So that's equal to 3 times 16
over 4, plus 64 over 3, minus

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.200
3/4 plus 1/3.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.600
OK, and now we gotta
work this out.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.950
So this is maybe 12, and the
thirds give me 21, so that's

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.010
33 minus 3/4.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:31.030
So that's 32 and 1/4, or 129
over 4, if you prefer.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.300
OK, so that's going to
be our answer there.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.790
So now let's go back and do it
again using this alternate

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.300
parametrization.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.480
So in this alternate
parametrization, we had x

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.710
equal e to the t, and
y equal e to the 2t.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.535
So in that case, that means that
dx --also x is e to the t

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:55.740
y equals 2t-- so our integral
that we want,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.870
let me rewrite it.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.130
Well, actually, let
me not rewrite it.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.220
Let me just go back here
and take a look at it.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.610
So we want the integral of F.dr,
and we know that that's

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.790
equal to the integral over C of
xy dx plus x squared plus y

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.280
squared dy.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.560
So x is e to the t, y is e to
the 2t, so that means dx is

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.870
going to be e to the t dt
and dy is going to be

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.680
2e to the 2t dt.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.150
So OK.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.070
So we'll just have to plug
these things in.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.770
So our integral--

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.630
maybe I'll give it a
name: What We Want.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.950
WWW.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.550
What We Want is equal to the
integral of, well we start

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.050
plugging in.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:50.550
So xy dx is e to the t times e
to the 2t times, we said dx is

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.460
e to the t dt.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.090
Plus, now x squared
plus y squared, so

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.080
that's e to the 2t--

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.170
that's x squared, plus
e to the 4t--

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.690
that's y squared--

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.920
times 2e to the 2t dt.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.926
That's dy.

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:13.390
Whew.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.360
OK.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.890
But this integral is missing
something, right?

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.780
Because it needs to be
a definite integral.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.600
Right now, I've written down
an indefinite integral.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.730
So that's a problem.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.190
So we need to think, what are
the bounds on this curve?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.150
What are we integrating
from and to?

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.680
So let's go all the way
back and look at the

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.310
problem over here.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.050
So this is the parametrization
of the curve, and we need it

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.250
to connect the points
1, 1 and 2, 4.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.230
So we need to know which value
of t puts this parametrization

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.210
at the point 1, 1, and which
value of t puts it at the

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.590
point 2, 4.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.270
Well, I think the easiest way
to do that is to solve this,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.200
and we have t equals
natural log of x.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.440
So natural log of 1 is 0,
and natural log of 2 is

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.730
natural log of 2.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.030
So OK.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.350
So we want t to go from
0 to natural log of 2.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.880
To go from this point
to that one.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.580
OK, so 0 to natural log of 2.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.320
Let's remember that, and
come back over here

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.770
and put that in.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.490
So we want this integral that
we're trying to compute using

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.550
this alternate parametrization--

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.830
we've already written down
what the integrand is--

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.370
but it's going to be the
integral, we just said, from 0

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.840
to the natural log of 2.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.280
OK.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.730
Great.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.710
So now let's take this integral
and let's start

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.220
simplifying it.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.540
So let's see.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.070
This is an e to the t times e to
the 2t times e to the t, so

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.820
that's e to the 4t dt.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.960
And here we have--

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.680
that looks like-- a 2e to the
4t plus 2e to the 6t dt.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:58.290
So if we combine like terms, we
get the integral from 0 to

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.470
natural log of 2.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.590
So we had an e to the 4t and a
2e to the 4t, so that's 3e to

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:12.710
the 4t plus 2e to the 6t dt.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.570
OK, 3e to the 4t plus
2e to the 6t.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.080
OK.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.590
And this is also a
different-looking integral

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.850
than the one we had before, but
it's not a difficult one

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.380
to evaluate, because it's just
e to a constant times t dt.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.350
Pretty straightforward
stuff, I think.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.720
So what does it actually
give us?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.370
Let me come up here and
write it up here.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.310
So this is equal to--

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.720
all right, integrate
e to the 4t--

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:45.040
and you get e to the 4t over 4,
so this is 3/4 e to the 4t,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.010
plus 2/6, so that's plus 1/3
e to the 6t, and we're

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.630
evaluating that between
0 and ln 2.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.730
And I will leave it to you to
confirm that what you get when

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.740
you do this is you get exactly
129 over 4 when you plug in

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.950
these values and take
the difference.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.360
So one thing to notice here is
that doing it with the second

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.710
parametrization, we
got 129 over 4.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.775
Now, if you look back just right
here, you see that when

00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:20.370
we did it with the first
parametrization, we also got

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.150
129 over 4.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.300
Now this is a general
phenomenon, right?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.120
The parametrization
doesn't change the

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.840
value of the line integral.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.370
So when you have a line integral
of a vector field,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.790
you can parametrize the curve
that you're integrating over

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.950
in a bunch of different ways.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.260
I mean, in fact, infinitely
many different ways.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.170
There are all sorts of different
choices, and they

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.310
all give the same answer.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.280
They have to.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.470
So no matter what
parametrization you choose,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.240
you get the same number out for
the line integral over the

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.440
same curve of the same
vector field.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:49.790
All right.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.505
So what that means for you is
that when you're given just a

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:55.870
curve and a vector field and
you get to choose your

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.010
parametrization, you should
always just choose whatever

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.910
the nicest one is.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.770
Because it doesn't matter which
one you choose, and

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.070
there's no reason
ever to choose

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.250
anything harder than necessary.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.280
All right.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.040
So now, I want to quickly
recap what we did.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:16.560
So we had a curve and a vector
field F, and we were asked to

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.740
compute the line integral of
F.dr, and we did it two

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.050
different ways.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.340
So in both cases, we used
the fact that F.dr

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.080
is M dx plus N dy.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.160
We wrote that out using the
known values of M and N, and

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.950
using the known components of F.
And then we plugged in for

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.530
both cases.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.600
In this case, we used that
first parametrization.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.270
And then over to my left,
we used this second

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.610
parametrization that
I gave you.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.180
And in both cases, that reduced
it to an integral in

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.220
terms of a single variable t
that was the parameter that we

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.880
could compute.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.250
And the answer came out the same
both times, as it had to.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.190
So one thing you can notice is
if you compare this with the

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.880
preceding lecture video, you'll
see that this curve and

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.010
vector field, they connect the
same points and it's the same

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.760
vector field, and these answers
both differ from both

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.620
of the answers in the preceding
recitation video.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.090
So this is further illustration
that different

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.520
curves can give you different
values, but if you take the

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.350
same curve, different
parametrizations always have

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.980
to give you same values for that
line integral of the same

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.940
vector field.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.630
I'll end there.
