DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:12.180
I'd like to work on a problem
with you, which is to compute

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.910
the volume of a parallelepiped
using 3 by 3 determinants.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.140
So here we've got the
parallelepiped drawn.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.550
It has, one of its vertices
is at the origin--

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.090
0, 0, 0--

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.860
and the other three edges are
given to us with these

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.590
coordinates here.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.420
So why don't you take some time
to work out this problem,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.980
pause the video, and check back
with me and I'll show you

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.230
how I solved it.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.880
OK, welcome back.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.350
Let's get started.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.380
So the first thing that we
need to do is we need to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.270
remember that computing volumes
of parallelepipeds is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.970
the same thing as computing
3 by 3 determinants.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:10.910
So the volume is just equal to
the determinant, which is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.460
built out of the vectors,
the row vectors

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710
determining the edges.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.990
So we have-- well, that's
almost true.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.135
This determinant will be either
a positive or negative

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.140
number and we always want to
take the positive number.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.540
So I'm going to write plus or
minus here, and we'll have to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.320
remember at the end that we
want a positive number.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380
So we can compute this
determinant using Laplace

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.040
expansion as we did
in the last video.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.030
So for Laplace expansion, we
take, can do Laplace expansion

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.470
on the first row.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.090
And that will again be nice,
because this 0 here will make

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.770
our computation simpler.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.050
And so, remember what we do is
we take the first entry in the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.340
row, and then we need to
multiply by the minor that we

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.480
get by covering up that
row and that column.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.940
So we have this little 2
by 2 determinant, which

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.273
looks like minus 1.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.450
And now we need to subtract
the next entry in the row

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.360
times its minor, which is now
this matrix 1, 1, 0, 1.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
So taking that determinant,
we get 1 minus 0.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.430
So altogether, we get 1.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.860
So what that tells us is that
our determinant is minus 4.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.180
But then that tells us that
our volume is plus 4.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.950
And I'll leave it at that.
