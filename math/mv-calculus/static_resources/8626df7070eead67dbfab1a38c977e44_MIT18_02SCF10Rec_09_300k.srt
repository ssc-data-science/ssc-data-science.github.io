00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,942
CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:12,700
In this video, what I want to
work on is using what we know

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,360
about matrix multiplication
and finding inverses of

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,420
matrices to solve a system
of equations.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,860
So we've set up the system
already as if it's already in

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,690
matrix form.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,550
And what I'd like us to do is,
for this particular A-- this 3

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,820
by 3 matrix A--

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,250
find a vector x, so
that Ax equals b.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,750
Where b is equal to
these two things.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,815
So you're going to
do two problems.

13
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:39,480
You're going to do when b
equals 1, 2, negative 3.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,220
And you're going to do when
b is equal to 0, 0, 0.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,220
So you want to find vector
x so that Ax

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,050
equals this value here.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,350
And what I'd like you to do
is I'd like you to use the

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,160
strategy that you saw in the
lecture, which is find A

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,110
inverse, and then take
A inverse b.

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,920
So we really want to practice
understanding how to find the

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,350
inverse of a matrix.

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,340
So why don't you work on this,
pause the video, when you feel

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,690
comfortable, confident, that
you have the right answer,

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,200
then bring the video back
up, and you can compare

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,450
your work with mine.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:18,030

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,080
OK, welcome back.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,330
Well, hopefully you were able
to make some headway and you

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,740
feel confident in your
answers for 1 and 2.

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,970
I am going to find the inverse
of the matrix A first, and

31
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,610
then solve the problem.

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,850
And because there's a
lot of computation,

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,980
I may make a mistake.

34
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,660
So I'm going to have to check
every once in awhile

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,830
that I'm doing OK.

36
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,310
so hopefully-- it's too bad you
can't tell me if I've made

37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,020
a mistake, but hopefully
my studio audience

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,260
will help me out.

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,360
So the first thing I need to
do is I need to find the

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,170
determinant of A. So I'm going
to do that first, and then I'm

41
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,540
going to find the cofactor
matrix and go from there.

42
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,880
So if I want to find the
determinant of A. I guess I'll

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,860
just use the first row here,
because it's pretty easy.

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
So the determinant of A is
going to be 3 times the

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,170
determinant of this matrix--

46
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,920
this 2 by 2 matrix.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,280
So it's going to be 3 times--

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,830
and then I get a 2 times
negative 1, which is negative

49
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,750
2, and then minus 0-- so I
get a 3 times negative 2.

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,050
Oops.

51
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,010
And I was about to write plus,
but I should write minus.

52
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,970
I take minus 1 times--

53
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,880
because this is my minus, I take
negative of this thing

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,920
times the matrix that is these
two components in the first

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,990
column and these two components

56
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,290
in the second column.

57
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:35,580
Right?

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,360
We take away the column and
the row that the 1 is

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,490
contained in and we look at
what remains-- the 2 by 2

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,460
matrix that remains.

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,240
And we find the determinant
of that.

62
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,060
So we get negative 1
times negative 1,

63
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,450
which gives me a 1.

64
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,960
And then negative 1 times
0 gives me a 0.

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,470
So I just have the negative 1
from the row 1, column 2 spot,

66
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,080
and then the determinant
of the matrix that

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,490
remains is 1, OK--

68
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,180
of the minor matrix
that remains.

69
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,110
And then the last one I should
put a plus, but notice that it

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,590
is a minus already, so I'm
going to put just minus 1

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,170
times what remains.

72
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,990
What's this minor?

73
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,740
This one is this 2 by 2 matrix
I'm looking at, right?

74
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,950
So I need to take the
determinant of this 2 by 2

75
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,620
matrix and multiply it by that
negative 1 to get the third

76
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,670
component here I
have to add in.

77
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,130
Negative 1 times negative
1 is 1.

78
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,490
And then I subtract negative
1 times 2.

79
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,660
So this is where I have
to be careful.

80
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,990
It's 1 minus negative 2.

81
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,400
So I'm going to get a 3.

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,670
OK.

83
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,910
1 here minus a negative
2-- so 1 plus 2--

84
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,710
I'm going to get a 3.

85
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,480
OK.

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,010
And so negative 6 minus
1 minus 3--

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,720
looks like I get
a negative 10.

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
That's good, because
I think that's what

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,210
I'm supposed to get.

90
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,340
OK.

91
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,460
Now what I want to do is I want
to find the matrix of

92
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,090
minors for A. And then
I'm going to find--

93
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,090
so I'm going to find the matrix
of minors first, and

94
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,180
then I'm going to switch the
signs appropriately so I get

95
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,010
the cofactors correct.

96
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,880
OK?

97
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,710
So some of them I already have.
But, the whole matrix of

98
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,370
minors, I'm going to just go
through and do it again to be

99
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,970
very careful.

100
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,960
So the first one I delete.

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,910
For the first row and column
spot, I delete row 1 and

102
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,030
column 1, and I look at the
determinant of that matrix.

103
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,520
That's 2 times negative 1 is
negative 2 minus 0, so I get a

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,510
negative 2 there.

105
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,650
For the first row, second column
I come back-- and I'm

106
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,650
now again looking, I'm deleting
this column and row--

107
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,230
and so I'm looking at the
determinant of this matrix.

108
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,890
So I get negative 1 times
negative 1 is 1, minus

109
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,150
0, so I get a 1.

110
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,900
Again, I'm going to change
all the signs later.

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,600
So I'm going to do that
in the second step.

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,020
Now I'm in row 1, column 3.

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,110
So I'm going to delete row 1,
column 3 and look at the

114
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,970
determinant of that matrix.

115
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,010
I get negative 1 times negative
1 is 1, minus the

116
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,820
negative 2, so there's my 3.

117
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,310
Those I already knew, but I
didn't want to just plop them

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,750
in from here.

119
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,000
But notice that is what
you get here.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,410
Negative 2, 1, and 3.

121
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,570
That's exactly where they
come from, right?

122
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,920
We got them by the
same method.

123
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,750
OK, and so now I want to find
the minors for the rest of it.

124
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,170
So let's look at, when I delete
row 2, column 1, I'm

125
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,200
left with 1, negative 1 here.

126
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,390
Negative 1, negative 1 here.

127
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,700
Right?

128
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,980
So 1 times negative
1 is negative 1.

129
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,830
And then negative and negative
is positive.

130
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,935
So it's negative 1 minus
negative 1, so I

131
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,200
get negative 2.

132
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,660
That one was a lot of signs,
so you might want to check.

133
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,300
Maybe I should check.

134
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,430
OK, maybe I should check.

135
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm deleting this column and
this row, so I get 1 times

136
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,290
negative 1.

137
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,290
That's a negative 1, right?

138
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,720
Negative 1 minus--

139
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,030
negative 1 times negative
1 is 1-- and so there's

140
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,080
negative 1 minus 1.

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,810
That looks good.

142
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,700
Negative 2.

143
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,060
Right?

144
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,800
Negative, negative, negative.

145
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah.

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,150
OK.

147
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,270
And then I'm looking
at row 2, column 2.

148
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,130
So now I'm deleting this
row and this column.

149
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,440
All right.

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,190
And so I have these sort
of diagonals here.

151
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,150
That's what I'm interested
in, right?

152
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,570
So I get 3 times negative 1.

153
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,100
That's negative 3.

154
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,290
And then minus 1, because I have
negative 1 times negative

155
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,260
1 is positive 1.

156
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,210
So negative 3 minus 1.

157
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,020
So I should get negative 4.

158
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,480
Right?

159
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,760
And then I'm over here.

160
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,800
So I need to delete this
column and this row.

161
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,010
So I get 3 times negative
1 is negative 3.

162
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,720
Minus the negative
1, that's plus 1.

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,340
So negative 3 plus
1 is negative 2.

164
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,450
And before I go on, I'm going
to check those first 2 rows.

165
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,950
Because if I made a mistake
now, it's only

166
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,990
going to get worse.

167
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,730
What did I have?

168
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,420
Yes.

169
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,690
OK.

170
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,930
So far so good.

171
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,750
Whew.

172
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,520
All right.

173
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,210
Next, final row.

174
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,800
OK, final row is, I'm going to
delete this column and row

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,470
here, and I'm looking
at this matrix.

176
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,720
1 times 0 is 0.

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,160
2 times negative 1 is negative
1, but I subtract that.

178
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,730
So it's 0 minus negative
2, so it's 2.

179
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,790
And then row 3, column 2.

180
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,300
So row 3, I delete row
3 and column 2.

181
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,090
3 times 0 is 0.

182
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,740
0 minus--

183
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,340
negative 1 times negative 1 is
1-- so 0 minus 1, that's

184
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,730
negative 1.

185
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,690
And then the last spot,
I'm deleting this

186
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,310
row and this column.

187
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,740
So 3 times 2 is 6 minus
negative 1.

188
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,280
I get 7.

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
All right, let's
check that row.

190
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
2, negative 1, 7.

191
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,490
OK.

192
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,530
I have not done the cofactor
matrix yet, because now I need

193
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,530
to change the appropriate
signs.

194
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,330
OK, so if this is the matrix of
minors, then if I want to

195
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,060
change it to the cofactor
matrix, what do I have to do?

196
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,190
I'm going to scratch this out
and write the cofactor matrix

197
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,230
so that we can just change
the signs appropriately.

198
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm going to do it
all right here.

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,570
And how does it work?

200
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,450
Well, remember I'm going to
go plus, minus, plus.

201
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,940
Minus, plus, minus.

202
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,830
Plus, minus, plus.

203
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,960
I have to do this grid that
starts with plus and

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
alternates minus.

205
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,190
So this sign stays the same,
this sign switches, this sign

206
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,090
stays the same.

207
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,630
That's the plus, minus, plus.

208
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,200
This one is going to be
minus, plus, minus.

209
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,690
So the minus switches that.

210
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,490
Plus keeps that the same.

211
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,430
Minus switches that.

212
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,010
And then I was at minus,
plus, minus.

213
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,300
So I'm going to have
plus, minus, plus.

214
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,690
And so these two stay the same,
and this one switches.

215
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,404
So a lot of things that were
negative became positive.

216
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,650
And I had to change--

217
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,090
maybe I threw in one negative,
maybe not.

218
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,720
But, so out all the signs I
kept, this one stayed the

219
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,550
same, this one stayed the same,
this one stayed the

220
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,140
same, these two stayed the
same, and then these 4

221
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,010
switched, because it's the plus,
minus, plus sort of grid

222
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,980
that I have to put
on top of this.

223
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,870
OK, so that's the
cofactor matrix.

224
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,620
We're getting closer.

225
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,830
OK, now we need the transpose
of this, right?

226
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,220

227
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,025
So if I look at the transpose,
actually, know what I'm going

228
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,070
to do-- because I'm also just
going to have to take the

229
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,330
transpose and then multiply it
by 1 over the determinant--

230
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,190
I'm going to do that
all at once.

231
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,980
OK.

232
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,380
Because we can do that all at
once, and then we don't have

233
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,750
to worry about it.

234
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,560
So A inverse I know is going to
be negative 1/10, because

235
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,720
the determinant was minus 10.

236
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,130
So it's 1 over the determinant
times the

237
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,790
transpose of this matrix.

238
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,544
So the transpose of this
matrix-- remember what I'm

239
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:37,650
going to do is essentially you
fix the diagonal and you're

240
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,000
going to flip.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,220
That's really what, in the
square matrix, that's how you

242
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,230
can think about it.

243
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,310
But every column is going
to become a row.

244
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,620
So I'm going to write this
as my first row.

245
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,500
This first column is going
to become my first row.

246
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,810
So it's going to be negative
2, 2, 2 as my first row.

247
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,720
And then the next column is
going to be negative 1,

248
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,670
negative 4, 1.

249
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,010
I mean next row.

250
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,930
I will take a column and
change it to a row.

251
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,220
The next row is going to be
negative 1, negative 4, 1.

252
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,360
And then the last one.

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,620
I take this column and
I change it to a row.

254
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,970
It's going to be 3, 2, 7.

255
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,290

256
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,780
OK.

257
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,530
And because again, I want
to make sure-- this

258
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,220
one is really messy--

259
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,550
I want to make sure I have
something similar for that, or

260
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,800
exactly that.

261
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,530
OK.

262
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,850
I think I'm still
doing all right.

263
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,670
Now, let's get to solving
the problem.

264
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,920
Because so far, we just were
finding the inverse matrix.

265
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,860
So I'm going to leave it in this
form, instead of dividing

266
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,290
by 10 in every spot, because
that will be annoying.

267
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,870
So let's think about how do I
want to solve the system.

268
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,990
That I had, I had Ax equals b.

269
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,470
And actually, I mean, my
strategy is to find the

270
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,770
inverse matrix.

271
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,300
I didn't talk to you about why
we know the inverse matrix

272
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,150
actually exists.

273
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,540
But ultimately, you haven't
even seen this yet in the

274
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,450
lecture videos, really.

275
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,690
Except that you know that the
determinant of A being

276
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,790
non-zero gives you an
inverse matrix.

277
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,750
That's all you know, I
think, at this point.

278
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,360
That you have the determinant
of A. It's non-zero, so you

279
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,100
can find an inverse matrix.

280
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,290
Makes sense based on the
formulation you have, because

281
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,300
if the determinant is 0, then
this quantity 1 over the

282
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,590
determinant of A, you've run
into quite a bit of trouble.

283
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,920
So that's just as a little
sidebar, we know the inverse

284
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,960
matrix exists for A.

285
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,340
So what we do--

286
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,470
this is again the strategy--

287
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,370
you multiply A inverse A times
x on the left side.

288
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,480
Ooh.

289
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Is equal to-- sorry-- that
should be the lowercase b.

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,370
Should be a vector there.

291
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,800
It is equal to A inverse b
on the right hand side.

292
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,880
And you notice, it's very
important, in the matrix

293
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,780
multiplication video we saw that
it's very important the

294
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,700
order in which you multiply
matrices.

295
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,120
And since I'm putting A inverse
on the far left of

296
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,940
this side of the equality, I
have to put it on the far left

297
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,620
of the right hand side
of the equality.

298
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,960
Right?

299
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,190
And in fact, you would run into
trouble if you tried to

300
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,430
switch the order of these.

301
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,760
OK?

302
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,250
We wouldn't be able
to multiply them.

303
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,000
All right?

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So A inverse A, we know is
just the identity matrix.

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,620
So you get the identity matrix
times x is equal

306
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,430
to A inverse b.

307
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,640
So you can find x by finding
A inverse times b.

308
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,470
Right?

309
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,140
And so now we have A inverse.

310
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,860
Let's see if we can
solve the problem.

311
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,830
One point I want to
make is that now

312
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,080
that you have A inverse--

313
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,440
I've tried to ask you to
solve the problem for

314
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,160
two different b's--

315
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,320
you don't have to go and find
A inverse again, right?

316
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
You're done finding A inverse.

317
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,130
You just now have to do
the multiplication.

318
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,660
So now for number 1, we
had b was equal to--

319
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm going to write it here,
so I don't have to

320
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,070
keep looking over--

321
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,120
1, 2, negative 3.

322
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,040
So A inverse b is going to be
equal to-- well I should get

323
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,860
another vector, so I
should just have

324
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,610
three components here.

325
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,200
And I'm probably going to have
to write out what I get,

326
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,370
because it might be long.

327
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,570
But let's see-- actually, you
know what I'm going to do to

328
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,050
make it easier?

329
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,620
Because there's a lot of
junk going on here.

330
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,510
So what I'm going to do to
make it easier is put the

331
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,340
negative 1/10 in
front to start.

332
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,740
Because that negative 1/10 is
going to come along with every

333
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,800
term, so I'm just going to put
the negative 1/10 in front and

334
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,290
deal with it at the end.

335
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,540
OK?

336
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,020
So now I'm just going to
multiply b-- which is this 1,

337
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,260
2, negative 3--

338
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,860
by this big matrix
here without the

339
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,480
negative 1/10 in front.

340
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,510
OK?

341
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,320
So let's look at that.

342
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,190
We're just going to have first
row times the column, and

343
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,020
that's going to give me
the first position.

344
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,115
So negative 2 times
1 is negative 2.

345
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm going to write
them all down.

346
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,350
Plus 2 times 2 is 4.

347
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,300
Plus 2 times negative
3 is negative 6.

348
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,730
So that's the first position.

349
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,920
We'll simplify in a moment.

350
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,180
So the next one, I get
negative 1 times 1.

351
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,490
That's negative 1.

352
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,450
Then I get negative 4 times 2.

353
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,550
That's negative 8.

354
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,190
So minus 8.

355
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,080
And then I get 1 times negative
3, so minus 3.

356
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,750
So we've got two of
the rows done.

357
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,940
We just have to simplify
them in a moment.

358
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,360
And now we just do this
third component.

359
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,080
So it's the third row of A
inverse without that scalar in

360
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,010
front, times the only
column of b to

361
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,810
give me the last position.

362
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,450
Right?

363
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,460
So 3 times 1 is 3, plus 2 times
2 is 4, so I get 3 plus

364
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,250
4, and then 7 times negative
3 is minus 21.

365
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,090
OK.

366
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,940
So what do I get when
I write it all out?

367
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,500
I get negative 1/10.

368
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,380
And then--

369
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,750
so negative 8 plus 4-- that
looks like a minus 4.

370
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,660
Right?

371
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,210
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

372
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,170
That looks like a negative 12.

373
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,310
It's a lot of adding for me.

374
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,820
I make a lot of adding
mistakes, so

375
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,950
we should be careful.

376
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,170
This looks like negative 14.

377
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,030
OK.

378
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,600
So this is a matrix that, it's
just a vector, right?

379
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,040
All the negative signs
will drop out.

380
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,750
I'll get some fractions.

381
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,370
But if it is the correct
answer-- which I'm really

382
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,510
hoping it is, because I just did
this whole problem and I

383
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,340
hope it's the correct answer--
if it's the correct answer,

384
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,640
then what should it do?

385
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,760
When I take the original A that
I had and I multiply it

386
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,020
by this, I should get b.

387
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,870
I should get 1, 2, negative 3.

388
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,670
So you can check your
work very easily

389
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,910
to see if it works.

390
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,350
You can take A times this,
and see if you get b.

391
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,340
Right?

392
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,740
And then you'll know if this is
the x we were looking for.

393
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,090
OK?

394
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,550
And then let's look
at number two.

395
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,260
I just said that b
equals 0, 0, 0.

396
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,499
And the point I want to make
there is that since this has

397
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:45,230
an inverse, A inverse, since A
has an inverse, A inverse b is

398
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,370
going to be--

399
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,960
in this case--

400
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,860
A inverse times 0, 0, 0, which
is going to give you 0, 0, 0.

401
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,280
So the only solution we
have in this case--

402
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,080
because A inverse, if I look and
I try and multiply every

403
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,220
row by this column, right, I'm
going to get 0 in the first

404
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,060
spot, 0 in the second spot,
and 0 in the third spot--

405
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,910
so the solution I get--

406
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,940
the x I'm looking for, so
that Ax equals 0, 0, 0--

407
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,760
is 0, 0, 0.

408
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,810
And what I just want to mention
to you, is that that

409
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,390
is true because A
is invertible.

410
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,260
If A were not invertible, you
could get other solutions.

411
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,230
Other things might work.

412
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,630
And that's also true, actually,
in this case as

413
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,860
well, but it's a little harder
to see that it could be

414
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,480
potentially a weird thing.

415
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,550
To solve Ax equals 0, 0, 0, it's
sort of like, naturally

416
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,380
we see 0, 0, 0 as a solution.

417
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,090
Right away you can see that,
and that's one that we get.

418
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,050
The point I want to make is
because A is invertible,

419
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,620
that's the only solution.

420
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,890
And if A were not invertible,
you could get other

421
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,260
solutions to that.

422
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,920
So that's something that we
haven't seen yet-- we haven't

423
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,780
dealt with yet--

424
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,140
but that is something
that can happen.

425
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,940
So I just want to point out that
there could be an oddity

426
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,490
if A were not invertible.

427
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,150
But since A is invertible, we
get just one solution for both

428
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,470
of these things.

429
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,740
OK.

430
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,120
So I'm going to go back and
just remind you of a few

431
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,470
things of how we found
the inverse matrix,

432
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,210
and then I will stop.

433
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,340
So we were given a matrix A. And
to go through the steps of

434
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,570
finding the inverse matrix,
what did we do?

435
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,900
The first thing we did was
we found the determinant.

436
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,690
Then we found the matrix
of minors.

437
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,810
And then I just took that matrix
of minors, put the plus

438
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,980
minus grid on top of
it so that I got

439
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,410
the cofactor matrix.

440
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,650
Right?

441
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,850
And then once I had the cofactor
matrix, you just have

442
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,580
to transpose it.

443
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,350
So I came over here.

444
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,220
I transposed that, and
I put 1 over the

445
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,260
determinant of A in front.

446
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,160
So the scalar is 1 over the
determinant of A times the

447
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,190
transpose of the cofactor
matrix.

448
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,180
And that's what gives
me A inverse.

449
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,710
So there are a fair number of
steps, but you can do them

450
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,160
very systematically, and then
you have the inverse matrix

451
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,300
that you're looking for.

452
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,220
And then you can solve for x
when you're looking for Ax

453
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,030
equals b, and you know b and
you know A. And you do this

454
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,010
same process we just outlined
here again, and

455
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,590
that gives it to you.

456
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,620
OK, I think I'll stop there.

457
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:07,955
