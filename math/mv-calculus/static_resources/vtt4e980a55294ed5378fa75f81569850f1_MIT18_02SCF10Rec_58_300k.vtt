CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.500
In this video, I'd like to do
two problems that ask us to

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.720
determine the flux of a vector
field along a surface.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.810
So the first one is I'd like you
to find the outward flux

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.830
of the vector z comma x comma
y through the piece of the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.110
cylinder that's shown.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.930
So it's just shading the
cylindrical part.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.620
So it's a cylinder of radius a,
and you're taking the piece

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.390
in the first octant
up to height h.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.620
So that's the first question
I'd like you to answer.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.750
Is the flux of this vector field
through that piece of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.730
the cylinder the outward flux?

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.230
And then I'd also like you to
find the outward flux of this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.580
vector field xz comma yz comma z
squared through the piece of

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.990
the sphere of radius a
in the first octant.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.960
So again, it will be in the
first octant like this one is

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.610
in the first octant.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.120
It'll be the piece of the sphere
that sits in the same

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.220
part of three-dimensional space
as the piece of the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.780
cylinder we're looking
at here.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.440
So what I'd like you to do,
again, is just find the flux--

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.810
in both cases, the outward
flux-- of the vector listed

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.880
through the surface
that is listed.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.810
And then when you feel
comfortable and confident with

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.450
your answer, you can bring the
video back up and I'll show

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.700
you how I did it.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.060
OK, welcome back.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.830
So again, what we're trying to
do is determine flux of a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070
vector field through
a surface.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.140
So I am going to determine first
what the normal is here,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.160
and then what F dot n is here,
and then using the fact that I

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.070
know F dot n and I know dS in
a good parametrization, I'm

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.380
going to be able to calculate
the integral quite simply.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.930
So let's point out first, that
the normal at any point on the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:58.050
surface is going to be equal to
x comma y comma 0 divided

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.440
by a, where a is, again,
the radius.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.390
Because in the normal, I know
there's no z component.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.890
And I actually know it's the
same as the normal would be on

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.100
a circle of radius a.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.570
And so this vector x comma y
has length a obviously, so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.450
that's why I'm dividing by a.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.340
So when I look at the normal and
I dot it with F, let's see

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.590
what I get.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.830
F dotted with the normal is
going to be xz plus xy divided

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.390
by a, right?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.010
So I just took x dotted with
x times z, y times z, and 0

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.620
times y, I add those up, and I
still have to divide by my a.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.170
So that's actually the vector
dotted with the normal.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.250
Now, what a natural
parametrization to use here is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.870
obviously the cylindrical
coordinates

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.680
because I'm on a cylinder.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.410
The radius is fixed.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.170
But what I'm interested in is
changes in theta and changes

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.710
in the height.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.930
So I'm going to be interested in
d theta and dz, and I need

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.180
to understand what dS
in this case is.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.850
And it's just a d theta dz.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.110
So let me write down what I'm
going to need to completely

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.150
determine the rest
of number one.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.460
I'm integrating over
the surface.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.510
And I'll put the bounds
momentarily.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.390
Actually, I should also point
out, I'm going to write x and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.480
y in terms of theta, because
now I know what they are.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.670
x in terms of theta is a cosine
theta, and y in terms

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.480
of theta is a sine theta.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.230
So when I simplify the
expression F dot n, I get z

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.380
times cosine theta for
my first component.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.140
And I get a times cosine
theta sine theta

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.390
for my second component.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.510
So let me maybe point out
again how I got that.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.190
Let me come over here.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.040
x is a cosine theta.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.040
So I get z times a cosine
theta divided by a.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.502
So I get z times cosine theta.

00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:04.080
x again is a cosine theta.
y is a sine theta.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.555
So I get a squared cosine
theta sine theta.

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.110
And I divide by a, so
I get a single a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.640
cosine theta sine theta.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.040
And then my dS, as I mentioned
before, is

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.900
a d theta dz, right?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.110
And so now I just have to figure
out the bounds in theta

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.050
and the bounds in z.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.060
Well, the bounds in
z are very easy.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.150
The bounds in z are simply 0 to
h, and so I'm going to put

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.870
those here on the outside.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.310
And then the bounds in theta.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.640
Maybe it's helpful to come over
and look at my picture.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.800
This direction, in the
x-direction, is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.130
theta equals 0.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.590
When I swing around to the
y-direction, I'm at theta

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.870
equals pi over 2.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.360
So I need to go from 0
to pi over 2, right?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.610
So let me come back over here.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.040
OK, so now, really, I have a
couple of constants that are

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.420
letters, but everything now,
I'm ready to integrate.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.550
So a is just a constant, and h
is a constant, and z and theta

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.860
are my variables, and I can
actually do this integration

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.800
quite simply.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.610
I'm not going to do it because
I know this is at this point

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.020
something we already know
how to do, but I'll

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.030
give you the answer.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.770
So let me write down
the answer.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.230
You get ah squared over 2,
plus a squared h over 2.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.500
So that's the solution
you actually get.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.560
So again, I mean you have to
integrate in d theta first. So

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.940
you have to deal with this, you
have to deal with this,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580
and this uses a good
trig identity.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.680
You can use the fact that 2
sine theta cosine theta is

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.930
sine 2 theta.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.370
I'll give you that little hint,
and then you can figure

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.040
it out from there.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.100
And then you integrate in z, and
you evaluate from 0 to h.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.500
So that's the solution
to number one.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.680
So now, let's look
at number two.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.930
Number two we have to
again figure out.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.780
We have our vector field and we
know our surface is a piece

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.180
of a sphere.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.280
And so if we're going to
parametrize the surface of a

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.270
sphere, we know we want to use
d theta and d phi, OK?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.300
And let me point out first,
that again, the normal is

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.590
going to be in some ways similar
to what we saw on the

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.870
cylinder, but now instead of x
comma y comma 0, because it's

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.770
a sphere, it's going to be x
comma y comma z divided by a.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.540
So again, as before, let me just
point out the normal that

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.190
I'm going to be using is
x comma y comma z,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.420
all divided by a.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.290
So I'm going to dot F with
n and look at the surface

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.700
integral with respect to dS--

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.250
d capital S there--

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.890
and I'll see what I get.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.490
So again, I know how I'm going
to parametrize this sphere.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.970
I already mentioned it, but
let me say it again.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.640
It's going to be in theta
and phi, right?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.000
Because we have a
constant radius.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.610
We're on a sphere of radius a.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.970
So I don't need to change rho.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.370
It's a two-dimensional thing.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.620
So theta is varying and
phi is varying.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.380
So let's see what we get first.
Let me do a little work

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.170
and see what we get when we
look at F dotted with n.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.540
So let me first point out that
F dotted with n looks like

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:21.000
it's x squared z plus y squared
z plus-- just to make

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.660
this obvious--

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.850
z squared z, all divided by a.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.860
x squared plus y squared plus z
squared is a squared, right?

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.750
So it's actually a squared
times z divided by a.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.460
So it's just a times z, right?

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.270
So far, all I've done was I
dotted F with the normal, and

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.630
I knew the fact that x squared
plus y squared plus z squared

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.030
was a squared, because I was
on a sphere of radius a.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.920
So a squared times z divided
by a is a times z.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.390
And now if I want to use the
right coordinates, think about

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.510
theta and phi.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.280
z is a cosine phi.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.800
So F dot n in the coordinates
I'm interested in is going to

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.990
be a squared cosine phi.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.760
So let me get out of the way
so you can see that.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.410
So that's what our
F dot n will be.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.490
And now, if we're going to
figure out the flux, of

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.560
course, it's the integral
of F dot n dS.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.200
And let's remind ourselves
what dS is.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:28.320
dS is going to be a squared
sine phi d theta d phi.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.270
You saw this in lecture,
actually, also.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.270
So this should look familiar.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.000
And so now I just have to
integrate F dot n dS over the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.910
right bounds for
theta and phi.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.490
So let's determine
what those are.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.050
I'll put everything together,
and we'll

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.160
determine what those are.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.950
So I've got F dot n dS.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:55.520
That's going to be a to the
fourth sine phi cosine phi d

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.830
theta d phi.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.780
And let's think about what is
the picture that I need in

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.570
terms of the first octant
of a sphere.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.840
Maybe I should draw a quick
picture over here so we can

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.800
remember what that looks like.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.050
So it's going to be--

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.800
this is not going to be the
greatest drawing ever-- but

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.500
it's something like this.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.310
And so I've got pieces of
a circle at each level.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.180
I've got a piece of
a circle, right?

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.960
If this is the x-direction, this
is the y-direction, and

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.250
this is the z-direction,
theta is going from 0--

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.190
again--

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:40.370
to pi over 2, and phi is going
from 0 to pi over 2, right?

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.060
So they're both going
from 0 to pi over 2.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.670
So hopefully, you were able to
get this far at least, in

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.540
terms of figuring out the
flux of F through that

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.490
piece of the sphere.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.350
And I'm, again, just going to
write down the solution, and

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.790
then you can check your answer
against the solution.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.930
And I got a to the fourth
over 4 times pi.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.900
So this whole solution
is a to the fourth

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.270
divided by 4 times pi.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.470
So you can check your
solution there.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.700
Again, I want to point out, what
we did in both of these

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.100
problems is we were trying to
compute the flux of a certain

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.070
vector field through
a surface.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.160
And if you'll notice, what I
actually did in this case is I

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.090
kept the parametrization in
terms of the x, y, z variables

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.270
first, and then I put it in the
parametrization of theta

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.550
and phi after.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.200
And that made it a little
easier to hang on to and

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.040
figure out what it was.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.780
Because notice, that x, y, and
z become very complicated in

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.070
theta and phi.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.780
I have to write a lot
more down, I guess.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.590
And then simplify things
more carefully.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.760
This way, it was very obvious
that I got an a squared times

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.030
z in the numerator.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.740
So sometimes it's a little
easier to compute the F dot n

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.720
in the initial x, y, z
variables, and then change it

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.540
to the appropriate
parametrization for the

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.230
surface you're looking at.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.220
So that's what we
did, actually.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.950
In both cases we computed F dot
n, we put it in the right

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.340
parametrization, and then we had
to figure out what dS was.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.650
We had to make sure we knew dS,
and then we just had to

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.670
integrate over the appropriate
bounds for our parameters.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.230
And that's giving us the flux
across the surface.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.000
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
