00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.790
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.050
In this video I'd like us to
consider the following problem.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.770
So the question is for what
simple closed curve C, which

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.870
is oriented positively around
the region it encloses,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.590
does the integral over
C of minus the quantity

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:32.550
x squared y plus 3x minus 2y dx
plus 4 y squared x minus 2x dy

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.510
achieve its minimum value?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.730
So again, the thing
we want to find here,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.210
the point we want to make,
is that we have this integral

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.390
and we're allowed
to vary C. So we're

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.860
allowed to change the curve,
the simple closed curve.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.310
And we want to know for what
curve C does this integral

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.950
achieve its minimum value?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.400
So why don't you work
on that, think about it,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.410
pause the video, and
when you're feeling

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.310
like you're ready to see how I
do it, bring the video back up.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.650
Welcome back.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.440
So again, what we would
like to do for this problem

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.760
is we want to take
this quantity, which

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.950
is varying in C, and
we want to figure out

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.520
a way to minimize it.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.910
To find its minimum value.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.250
And actually what's
interesting to think about,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.950
before we proceed
any further, is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060
you might think you want to take
the smallest possible simple

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.980
closed curve you can.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.680
In other words, you might want
to shrink it down to nothing.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.670
But then this integral would
be 0 and the question is,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.859
can we do better?

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.900
Because we could have a
minimum value, of course,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.760
that's negative.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.790
And so we could do
better by having a larger

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.360
curve put in the right place.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.750
So I just want to point that
out, if you were thinking

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.770
"I'll just make C
not actually a curve,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.430
I just shrink it
down to nothing."

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.840
That won't be the
best we can do.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.800
We can actually
find a curve that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.100
has an integral that is not
0, but is in fact negative.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.680
And then we want to make it
the most negative we can.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.380
So that's the idea.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.510
So what we're
going to do here is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.920
we're going to use Green's
theorem to help us.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200
And so what we want to remember
is that if we have the integral

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:24.490
over C of M*dx plus N*dy we want
to write that as the integral

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.055
over R of N sub x
minus M sub y dx dy.

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.500
So what I want to
point out, I'm just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.470
going to write down
what these are.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.132
I'm not going to take
the derivatives for you.

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:42.840
I'm just going to show
you what they are.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.650
So in this case, with
the M and N that we have,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.540
we get exactly this
value for the integral.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.560
We get N sub x minus M sub
y is equal to x squared

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.154
plus 4 y squared minus 4 dx dy.

00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:04.820
You can obviously
compute that yourself.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.370
Just take the derivative
of N with respect to x,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.330
subtract the derivative
of M with respect to y,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.110
you get a little cancellation
and you end up with this.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.210
And so now, instead of
thinking about trying

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.320
to minimize this quantity
over here in terms of a curve,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.170
now we can think about trying
to minimize the quantity here

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.710
in terms of a region.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.920
And the goal here
is to make the sum

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.744
of all of this over
the whole region--

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:36.160
we want to make it as negative
as we can possibly make it.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.870
So essentially
what we want to do

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.050
is we want-- on the
boundary of this region,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.690
we would like the
value here to be 0,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.930
and on the inside of the region
we'd like it to be negative.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.210
So let me point that
out again and just

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.620
make sure we understand this.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.350
To make this quantity
as small as possible,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.920
what we would like--
let me actually

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.960
just draw a little region.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.750
So say this is the region.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.060
To make this integral as small
as possible, what we want

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.530
is that x squared plus
4 y squared minus 4 is

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.960
negative inside the region.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.770
So if this whole quantity is
less than 0 inside the region,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.030
and we want it to, on the
boundary of the region,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.090
equal 0.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.444
And why do we want it to
equal 0 on the boundary?

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:22.860
Well, that's because then we've
gotten all the negative we

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.840
could get and we haven't
added in any positive

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.150
and brought the value up.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.640
So that's really why we want
the boundary of the region

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.750
to be exactly where
this quantity equals 0.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.980
And so let's think about,
geometrically, what

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.480
describes R-- oops,
that should have an s.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.880
What describes R,
where x squared

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.220
plus 4 y squared minus 4
is less than 0 inside R,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.110
and that's the same thing as--
in what we're interested in-- x

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:21.960
squared plus 4y squared minus 4
equals 0 on the boundary of R.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.930
And if you look at this,
this is really the expression

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.270
that will probably help you.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.470
This expression,
if you rewrite it,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.820
you rewrite it as x squared
plus 4y squared is equal to 4.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.010
And you see that this is
actually the equation that

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.000
describes an ellipse.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.830
Maybe you see it more often
if you divide everything by 4,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.780
and so on the right-hand
side you have a 1,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.930
and your coefficients are
fractional, potentially, there.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.170
But this is exactly the
equation for an ellipse.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.790
And so the boundary of R
is an ellipse described

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.795
by this equation,
but the boundary of R

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.070
is actually just C.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.840
So C we now know is
exactly the curve

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.830
that is carved out by this
equation on the plane,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.840
on the xy-plane.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.930
That's an ellipse.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.279
So just to remind you
what we were trying to do.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.820
If you come back
here, we were trying

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.340
to figure out a way to
minimize the certain integral

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.020
over a path.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.280
And what we did was
instead of trying

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.484
to look at a bunch of
paths and figure out

00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:29.900
what would minimize
that, we tried

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.570
to see if Green's
theorem would help us.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.744
So Green's theorem allowed
us to take something

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:35.660
that was an integral
over a path and change it

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.790
to an integral over a region.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.070
And then when we look at
what we ended up with,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.930
we realize that we could
make this the most minimum

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.310
if we let this be on the
region where it was negative

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.199
everywhere.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.740
So we were looking
for a region where

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.890
this quantity was everywhere
negative on the inside and 0

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.250
on the boundary.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.950
And that's exactly what we did.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.429
And then we see that
we get to a point

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:00.970
where the boundary
has this equation,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.340
x squared plus 4y
squared equals 4.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.310
We see then the
boundary's an ellipse,

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.660
and C is indeed the
boundary of the region.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.420
So we see that C is the ellipse
described by this equation.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.934
So that's where I'll stop.
