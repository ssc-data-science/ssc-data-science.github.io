00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:07,690
JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,309
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,600
In lecture, you've been
learning about Stokes' Theorem.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,480
And I have a nice
question here for you

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,466
that can put Stokes'
Theorem to the test.

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:16,840
So what I'd like
you to do is I'd

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,300
like you to consider
this field F.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,910
So its components
are 2z, x, and y.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,450
And the surface S that is the
top half of the unit sphere.

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,930
So it's the sphere
of radius 1 centered

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,080
at the origin, but
only its top half.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,540
Only the part where z is
greater than or equal to 0.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,480
So what I'd like you to do
is to verify Stokes' Theorem

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,540
for this surface.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,650
So that is, I'd
like you to compute

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,870
the surface integral
that comes from Stokes'

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,630
Theorem for this surface,
and the line integral that

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,650
comes from Stokes'
Theorem for the surface,

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,030
and check that they're
really equal to each other.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,310
Now, before we
start, we should just

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,610
say one brief thing about
compatible orientation.

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,380
So I didn't give you
any orientations,

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,350
but of course, it doesn't
matter as long as you

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,170
choose ones that are compatible.

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,620
So if you think about your rules
that you have for finding them.

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,540
So if you imagine yourself
walking along this boundary

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,940
circle with your left
hand out over that sphere.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,270
So you'll be walking in this
counterclockwise direction

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,970
when your head is sticking
out of the sphere.

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,470
All right?

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,680
So in other words, the outward
orientation on the sphere

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,640
is compatible with the
counterclockwise orientation

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,130
on the circle that
is the boundary.

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,340
So let's actually put
in a little arrow here

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,835
to just indicate that is our
orientation for the circle.

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,010
And our normal is an
outward-pointing normal.

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,685
And let's call our
circle C, and our S

38
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,620
is our sphere is our surface.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,230
OK.

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,701
So just so we have
the same notation.

41
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,200
Good.

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,630
So why don't you work this
out, compute the line integral,

43
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,354
compute the surface
integral, come back,

44
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:59,770
and we can work
them out together.

45
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,300
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,260
We have two things to compute.

47
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,500
I think I'm going to start
with the line integral.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,960
So let me write that
down: line integral.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
So what I need to do
to compute the line

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,050
integral is I need to compute
the integral over the curve

51
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:41,290
C of F dot dr. And so I know
what F is on that circle.

52
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,444
So I need to know what dr is.

53
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:44,610
So I need to know what r is.

54
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,400
I need a parametrization
of that circle.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,440
Well, you know, that is a pretty
easy circle to parametrize.

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,800
It's the unit circle
in the xy-plane.

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,690
So we have-- for C, we have--
and we're wandering around it

58
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,760
counterclockwise.

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,485
So it's our usual
parametrization.

60
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,360
It's the one we like.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:10,030
So we have x equals cosine
t, y equals sine t--

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,450
where t goes from 0 to
2*pi-- and this is in three

63
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,960
dimensions, so the other part of
the parametrization is z equals

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,730
0.

65
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,310
So this is my parametrization
of this circle.

66
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,370
OK, so let's go ahead
and put that in.

67
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:44,160
So the integral over C of F
dot dr is the integral from 0

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,370
to 2 pi.

69
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,670
So we've got three parts.

70
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:53,030
So the first part--
so F is 2z, x, y.

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,690
So it's 2z*dx plus
x*dy plus y*dz.

72
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,900
But z is 0 on this whole circle.

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,190
So that piece just dies.

74
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,470
And dz is also 0, so
that piece just dies.

75
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,490
So we're just left with x*dy.

76
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,521
So this is equal to
the integral x dy.

77
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,020
Oh.

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,620
So I guess this is
not from 0 to 2*pi.

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,411
This is still over
C. Sorry about that.

80
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:18,910
OK.

81
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:25,670
And now I change to
my parametrization.

82
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,170
OK.

83
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,730
Yes.

84
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,230
Right.

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,430
So this is still in dx, dy,
dz form, so it's still over C.

86
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,230
Now we switch to the dt form, so
now t is going from 0 to 2*pi.

87
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,550
OK, so now we have x*dy.

88
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,430
So x is cosine t, and
dy-- so y is sine t,

89
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,680
so dy is cosine t dt.

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,090
So this is cosine t times
cosine t, is cosine squared t.

91
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,820
dt, gosh.

92
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,545
So now you have to
remember way back in 18.01

93
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,920
when you learned how to compute
trig integrals like this.

94
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,952
So I think the thing
that we do, when

95
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:01,410
we have a cosine squared t, is
we use a half-angle formula.

96
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,390
So let me come back down
here just to finish this off

97
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,190
in one board.

98
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,570
OK, so cosine squared t is
the integral from 0 to 2*pi.

99
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:20,410
So cosine squared t is 1
plus cosine 2t over 2, dt.

100
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,960
And now cosine 2t, as t goes
between 0 and 2*pi, well,

101
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,381
that's two whole loops of it.

102
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:27,880
Right?

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,650
Two whole periods of cosine 2t.

104
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,280
And it's a trig function.

105
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,504
It's a nice cosine function.

106
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,670
So the positive parts and
the negative parts cancel.

107
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,200
The cosine 2t part, when we
integrate it from 0 to 2*pi,

108
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,830
that gives us 0.

109
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,340
So we're left with 1/2
integrated from 0 to 2*pi,

110
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,202
and that's just going to give
us 1/2 of 2*pi, so that's pi.

111
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:50,980
All right.

112
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,480
So good.

113
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,730
So that was the line integral.

114
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,540
A very straightforward thing.

115
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,910
We had our circle back here.

116
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,150
We had our field.

117
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,170
So we parametrized
the curve that

118
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,500
is the circle, that
is the boundary.

119
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,690
And then we just computed
the line integral,

120
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,750
and it was a nice,
easy one to do.

121
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,090
You had to remember one
little trig identity in order

122
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,170
to do it.

123
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,230
All right.

124
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,360
That's the first one.

125
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,290
So let's go on to
the surface integral.

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,570
So the surface
integral that you have

127
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,870
to compute in Stokes'
Theorem is you

128
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,720
have to compute
the double integral

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:42,340
over your surface of the
curl of F dot n with respect

130
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,090
to surface area.

131
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,610
So this is the integral
we want to compute here.

132
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,210
So OK.

133
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,793
So the first thing
we're going to need

134
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:52,440
is we're going to need
to find the curl of F.

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,754
So F-- let me just write it
here so we don't have to walk

136
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:56,920
all the way back over there.

137
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,030
So F is [2z, x, y].

138
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,950
So curl of F-- OK, you should
have lots of experience

139
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,755
computing curls by
now-- So it's going

140
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,690
to be this-- I
always think of it,

141
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,400
so you've got these
little 2 by 2 determinants

142
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,160
with the partial derivatives
in them, but most of those

143
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,360
are going to be 0.

144
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,940
We've got a d_x x term
that's coming up in k,

145
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,410
and a d_y y term
that's coming up in i,

146
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,471
and a d_z 2z term
that's coming up in j.

147
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:32,970
So OK.

148
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,370
So almost half the terms are 0.

149
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,160
The others are really
easy to compute.

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,790
I trust that you can
also compute and get

151
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,300
that the curl is [1, 2, 1] here.

152
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,891
OK, so this is F. This
is curl of F. Great.

153
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:47,390
So OK.

154
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,260
So that's curl of F.

155
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,250
So now we need n.

156
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, let's think.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,880
So we need the unit
normal to our surface.

158
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,260
So back at the beginning
before we started,

159
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,780
we said it was the
outward-pointing normal.

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,460
So we need the
outward-pointing normal.

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,360
Well, this is a sphere, right?

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,790
So the normal is parallel
to the position vector.

163
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,270
So that means n
should be parallel

164
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,850
to the vector [x, y, z].

165
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,270
So n should be parallel
to this vector [x, y, z],

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,590
but in fact, we're
even better than that.

167
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,380
We're on a unit sphere.

168
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,230
So the position vector
has length of 1.

169
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,132
So n should be pointing in the
same direction as this vector,

170
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,090
and they both have length
1, so they had better

171
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,460
be equal to each other.

172
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,520
Great.

173
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,320
So this unit normal n is
just this very simple vector,

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,570
[x, y, z].

175
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,980
If it had been a
bigger sphere, then you

176
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,700
would have to divide
this by the radius

177
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,910
to scale it appropriately.

178
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,280
All right.

179
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,770
So we've got curl
F. We've got n.

180
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:02,140
So the integral that we
want is this double integral

181
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,400
over the surface
of curl F dot n.

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:14,290
So that's x plus 2y plus z,
with respect to surface area.

183
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,840
OK.

184
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,790
Well, now we've just
got a surface integral.

185
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,800
It's over a hemisphere.

186
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,574
Not a terrible thing
to parametrize.

187
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,740
So that's what we should do.

188
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,850
We should go in, we
should parametrize it,

189
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,050
and then we should just compute
it like a surface integral,

190
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,140
like we know how to do.

191
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,905
So before we start
though, I want

192
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,640
to make one little observation.

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,430
Well, maybe two
little observations.

194
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,370
We can simplify this.

195
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,040
All right?

196
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,180
x.

197
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,880
We're integrating x over
the surface of a hemisphere

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,820
centered at the origin.

199
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,150
This hemisphere is
really symmetric.

200
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,320
And on the back
side-- the part where

201
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,690
x is negative-- we're getting
negative contributions from x.

202
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,210
And on the front
side-- where x is

203
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,310
positive-- we're getting
positive contributions from x.

204
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,770
And because this sphere
is totally symmetric,

205
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,440
those just cancel
out completely.

206
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:12,850
So when we integrate x
over the whole hemisphere,

207
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,060
it just kills itself.

208
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,185
I mean, the negative parts
kill the positive parts.

209
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:16,880
We just get 0.

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,690
Similarly, this hemisphere is
symmetric between its left side

211
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,270
and its right side, and so
the parts where y are negative

212
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,770
cancel out exactly the
parts where y are positive.

213
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,010
So as a simplifying
step, we can realize,

214
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,120
right at the beginning,
that this is actually

215
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,040
just the integral over S of z
with respect to surface area.

216
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,289
Now, if you didn't
realize that, that's OK.

217
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,830
What you would have
done is you would

218
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,280
have done the parametrization
that we're about to do.

219
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,770
And in doing that
parametrization,

220
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,320
you would have found that you
were integrating something like

221
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,600
cosine theta between 0 and
2*pi, or something like this.

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,110
And that would have given you 0.

223
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,250
So you would have
found this symmetry,

224
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,290
even if you didn't
realize it right now,

225
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,850
you would have found it in
the process of computing

226
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,640
this integral, but it's
a little bit easier on us

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,910
if we can recognize
that symmetry first.

228
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,960
Now, notice that z doesn't
cancel, because this is just

229
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,850
the top hemisphere, so it
doesn't have a bottom half

230
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,750
to cancel out with.

231
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,250
Right?

232
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,930
So the z part we can't
use this easy analysis on.

233
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,204
If we integrated this z
over the whole sphere--

234
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:26,120
if we had the other half
of the sphere-- well,

235
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,550
then that would also give us 0.

236
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,980
But we only have the
top half of the sphere.

237
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,315
So it's going to give us
something positive, because z

238
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,940
is always positive up there.

239
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,470
OK, so let's actually set
about parametrizing it.

240
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,800
We want to parametrize
the unit sphere.

241
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,440
Well, OK.

242
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,430
So we have our standard
parametrization

243
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,220
that comes from
spherical coordinates.

244
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,120
So rho is just 1.

245
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,670
Right?

246
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,917
So x is equal to, it's
going to be cosine--

247
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:55,500
You know what?

248
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,430
I always get a little
confused, so I'm just

249
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,320
going to check, carefully, that
I'm doing this perfectly right.

250
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,660
x is going to be
cosine theta sine phi.

251
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,520
Good.

252
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,370
y is going to be
sine theta sine phi.

253
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,250
And z is going to be cosine phi.

254
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,140
So that's our parametrization.

255
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,820
But we need bounds, of
course, on theta and phi

256
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,376
in order to properly describe
just this hemisphere.

257
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,000
So let's think.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,600
So for phi, we
want the hemisphere

259
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,200
that goes from the z-axis
down to the xy-plane.

260
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,360
So that means we
want 0 to be less

261
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,931
than or equal to phi to be less
than or equal to pi over 2.

262
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,430
Right?

263
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,594
That will give us
just that top half.

264
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:49,760
And we want the whole thing.

265
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,134
We want to go all
the way around.

266
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:55,850
So we want 0 less than or equal
to theta less than or equal

267
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,970
to 2*pi.

268
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,760
OK, so this is what
x, y, and z are.

269
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,320
These are the bounds for our
parameters phi and theta.

270
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,740
Now, the only
other thing we need

271
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,150
is we need to know what dS is.

272
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,540
So in spherical
coordinates, we know

273
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,270
that dS-- I'll put it
right above here-- so dS

274
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:26,530
is equal to sine
phi d phi d theta.

275
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,966
Let me again just double-check
that, that I'm not

276
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:29,840
doing anything silly.

277
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,120
So dS is equal to sine
phi d phi d theta.

278
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,750
So we've got our
parametrization.

279
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,450
We've got our bounds
on our parameters.

280
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,709
We know what dS is.

281
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,750
And we have the integral
that we want to compute.

282
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,583
So now we just have to
substitute everything

283
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,760
in and actually compute it
as an iterated integral.

284
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,380
Great.

285
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,420
So let's do that.

286
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,100
So, this integral
that we want, I'm

287
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,510
going to write a big
equal sign that's

288
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,870
going to carry me
all the way up here.

289
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,080
That's an equal sign.

290
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,580
All right.

291
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,480
So our integral, the
integral over S of z

292
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,010
with respect to surface area.

293
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,700
So z becomes cosine phi.

294
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,070
So we've got our double integral
becomes an iterated integral.

295
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,670
z becomes cosine phi.

296
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,940
dS becomes sine
phi d phi d theta.

297
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,430
And our bounds.

298
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:38,510
So let's see: phi we said is
going from 0 to pi over 2.

299
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,450
Zero, pi over 2.

300
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,480
And theta is going
from 0 to 2*pi.

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,200
OK.

302
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,110
So now we just have a
nice, straightforward

303
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,750
iterated integral
here to compute.

304
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,460
So let's do the inner one first.

305
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,940
So we're computing--
the inner integral

306
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:07,060
is the integral from 0 to pi
over 2, of cosine phi sine phi

307
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,001
d phi.

308
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:08,500
And OK.

309
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,770
So there are a bunch
of different ways

310
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,060
you could do this.

311
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,839
If you wanted to get fancy, you
could do a double-angle formula

312
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,880
here, but that's really
more fancy than you need.

313
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,970
Because this is like sine
phi times d sine phi, right?

314
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,670
So this is equal
to-- another way

315
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,040
of saying that is you can
make the substitution u equals

316
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,990
sine phi.

317
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,470
Anyhow, this is all Calc I
stuff that hopefully you're

318
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,551
pretty familiar with.

319
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:35,050
So OK.

320
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,400
So this is equal
to-- in the end,

321
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,020
we get sine squared phi over
2, between 0 and pi over 2.

322
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,520
OK.

323
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,311
So we plug this in.

324
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,670
So sine squared pi
over 2, that's 1/2,

325
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,280
minus-- sine squared
0 over 2 is 0 over 2.

326
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,200
So it's just 1/2.

327
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,180
So the inner integral is 1/2.

328
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,906
So let's see about
the outer one.

329
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:06,080
The outer integral is just the
integral from 0 to 2*pi d theta

330
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,100
of whatever the
inner integral was.

331
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,370
Well, the inner
integral was 1/2.

332
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,660
So the integral from 0
to 2*pi of 1/2 is pi.

333
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,500
Straightforward.

334
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,000
Good.

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,500
So OK.

336
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,490
So that's what the
surface integral gives us.

337
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,090
So let's go back
here and compare.

338
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,450
So way back at the beginning
of this recitation,

339
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,120
we did the line
integral for this circle

340
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,360
that's the boundary of this
hemisphere, and we got pi.

341
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,667
And just now what we did is
we had the surface integral--

342
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,000
the associated surface integral
that we get from Stokes'

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,570
Theorem, this curl F dot n dS.

344
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,320
So we computed F
and curl F and n.

345
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,455
And then we'd noticed a
little nice symmetry here.

346
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:51,830
Although if you
didn't notice it,

347
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,060
you should have had no trouble
computing the extra terms

348
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,240
in the integral that you
actually ended up with it.

349
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,140
It would've been another
couple of trig terms

350
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,230
there after you made
the substitution.

351
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,320
So we parametrized
our surface nicely.

352
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,650
Because it's a sphere,
it's easy to do.

353
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,880
And then we computed
the double integral

354
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,682
and we also came out with pi.

355
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,390
And we better have
also come out with pi,

356
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,180
because Stokes' Theorem
tells us that the line

357
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,554
integral and the
surface integral

358
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,624
have to give us the same value.

359
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,290
So that's great.

360
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,790
So that's exactly what we
were hoping would happen.

361
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,020
And now we've sort of
convinced ourselves, hopefully,

362
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,350
that through an
example now, we have

363
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,766
a feel for what sorts of things
Stokes' Theorem can do for us.

364
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,360
I'll end there.
