00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.760
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.310
In this video, what I'd like
you to do is use Green's theorem

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.440
to find the area between
one arch of the cycloid that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.080
is described by x equals
a times the quantity

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.780
theta minus sine theta, y equals
a times the quantity 1 minus

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.450
cosine theta, and the x-axis.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.240
So probably it's
helpful for you to draw

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.690
a picture of this first.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.880
So you have one arch
of the cycloid defined

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.790
in terms of theta, the x of
theta and y of theta are here,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060
and then the x-axis
will be the other bound.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.510
And the big thing I
want you to notice

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.100
is you're going to use Green's
theorem to find the area.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.884
So why don't you pause the
video, work on the problem,

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:47.550
when you're ready to
see my solution you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.716
can bring the video back up.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.990
OK, welcome back.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.080
So again, what we want to do is
we want to use Green's theorem

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.854
to find an area.

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:06.270
OK, and what I'm
going to do first

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.290
is I'm going to try and figure
out what the picture looks like

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.081
and then I'm going to
figure out how to use

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:13.450
Green's theorem in this region.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.020
So lets first draw a sketch of
the picture of what's going on.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.560
And because I want the area
between one arch of the cycloid

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.860
and the x-axis, what I
really want to do first

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.660
is figure out what
theta values will

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.520
make y positive, or
greater than or equal to 0,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.580
and go from there.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.050
So if I want y to be
greater than or equal to 0,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.070
then what I need is
1 minus cosine theta

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.390
to be greater than
or equal to 0.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.790
And that's going to happen for
every theta from 0 to 2*pi,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.200
and at 0 and 2*pi I get 0.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.090
So we know we want theta
to go between 0 and 2*pi.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.250
Those are good parameters
to have for theta,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.870
because this statement
is always true,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.500
but I get 0 when theta is
0 and when theta is 2*pi.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.690
So I'm going to let theta
run between 0 and 2*pi,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.995
as I mentioned.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:05.870
So now let's think about
what the picture is.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.070
When theta is 0, if I come over
to what x is, x is a times 0

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.120
minus 0, So x is 0.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.600
And y we said was 0.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.540
I know that I'll
achieve a maximum height

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.110
at theta equal pi because that's
where cosine theta is minus 1.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.440
So the 1 minus
cosine theta is 2.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.500
And so if you look at
what the y-value will be,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.000
the y-value when
theta is pi is 2a.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.850
And the value is going to
be a times pi minus sine pi.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.000
Well, sine of pi is 0.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.270
So I just get a*pi.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.790
So I should go over a*pi.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.680
And I know there's a point at
a*pi comma-- I think I said 2a.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.810
And then it's actually going
to come back down the same way,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.330
so let me draw the first part.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.834
This is not a perfect
drawing of this.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.000
I don't have lots of points.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.666
I'm having the smallest
amount of points

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.190
possible to figure
out what's happening.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.360
So then when theta is 2*pi,
1 minus cosine theta is 0.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.770
So I get y equals 0.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.020
And then here I get 2
pi minus sine of 2*pi.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.640
Sine of 2 pi is 0,
so I get 2*pi*a.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.290
So I come all the way over
here and I get 2*pi*a.

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:30.920
Yeah, that's not maybe the
most beautiful picture,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.480
but it's a good start.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.490
So I'm interested in finding
the area of this region.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.790
What I want to do then is, to
find the area of that region

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.650
I'm going to use
Green's theorem.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.260
That's what we asked you to do.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.985
So what I want to do is I
want to pick a curve that's

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:48.110
going to have 2 components.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.151
It's going to have C_1,
will be this bottom part,

00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:51.670
and C2 will be this top part.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.640
And we need to
keep it oriented so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.800
when I'm walking along the
curve the region is on the left.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.200
And then I have to figure out
how to use Green's theorem.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.080
So to find the area of this
region, all I actually need

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.610
is the integral over
the region of dA.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.270
That would give me the area.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.300
And so what quantities--
what functions would be good?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.940
Sorry.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.330
In order to find this.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.540
Well, I believe you
actually saw in class

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.670
that you have two options.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.810
You have minus y*dx
over the closed curve,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.680
or you have x*dy over
the closed curve.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.320
You have one of
those two options.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.050
Now which one of those
is better in this case?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.950
We have a choice, so let's
make the best choice.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.470
Which one of those is better?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.090
Well, if you notice that
on these two curves,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.180
x is changing on both of them
but y is fixed on this one.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.390
So it'd be nicer for
us if we could just

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.930
integrate on the curve
on this part, which

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.510
we would be able to do if
we were choosing this one.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.790
Because y is constant and
it is equal to 0 along here.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.810
So what you need to do to
solve this problem is really,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.410
you only need to integrate
on C_2, minus y*dx.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.010
That's going to give
you the entire area.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.390
And so now we have to figure
out how to put everything in.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.940
Well, C_2-- I'm
parameterized in theta--

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.310
and C_2 parameterized in theta,
if I start here I'm at 2*pi

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.340
for theta.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.161
And if I go this direction
I'm at 0 for theta.

00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.660
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.870
to do something that might seem
tricky, but it's quite natural.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.370
I'm going to replace this minus
by a plus and then integrate

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.590
from 0 to 2*pi.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.430
Because I was going to be
integrating from 2*pi to 0

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.430
and so I just flipped the order
and made that sign a plus.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.690
So that should be fine.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.450
And then y, I already
know what it is.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.990
It's a times 1
minus cosine theta.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.250
And now I just have to
figure out what is dx.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.180
So we have to come back
over, for one second

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.980
we're going to come over here
and we're going to look at dx.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.310
If x is equal to a times
theta minus sine theta,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.590
then dx is just a times
1 minus cosine theta.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.240
So that's nice because that's
actually what we already have.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.680
So we come back
over here-- oh, I

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.100
should say also with a d
theta-- come back over here,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.930
dx gives you a squared a,
it gives you a squared this,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.560
and it gives you a d theta.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.640
So that actually gives
you everything you need.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.470
Now I am not going to actually
write out all the steps

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.810
in order to do this.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.370
But the way you
could easily do this,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.380
you can pull out the
a squared and you're

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.980
left with a 1 minus
cosine theta squared.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.200
You might think about
squaring all the terms

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.990
and then you have 1 cosine
squared theta to deal with.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.340
But ultimately, when
you get your answer--

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.290
I'm just going to
write down what it is--

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.180
you get 3*pi a squared.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.420
And you'll see you get a
little bit of cancellation

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.311
and it's not too hard
to solve at this point.

00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.810
Since it's single
variable I'm going

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.480
to assume I don't need to do it.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.980
But you can check
your final answer.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.720
You should get-- I think, yes.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.740
I got 3*pi a squared.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.390
So what we did was we
took a problem, again,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.040
where we had a curve
defined in terms of theta.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.270
We had a curve, in x and y,
it was parameterized in theta.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.270
And we wanted to find an
area between that curve

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.000
and the x-axis.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.360
And the reason we could use
Green's theorem so easily is

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.810
because area of a region-- of
this connected region here--

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.700
is equal to the integral over
the closed loop surrounding it

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.060
of minus y*dx, or alternatively
you could have done x*dy.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.974
And because I got to choose,
I picked the easier one.

00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:45.640
And I picked the
easier one in this case

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.270
because y is equal to 0
on one part of the curve.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.140
So I just ignored the C_1
because that's where y is 0,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.150
and I looked along C_2.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.520
I noticed C_2 is parameterized
in this direction from theta

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.080
equals 2*pi to theta equals 0.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.750
So that's why I dropped the
minus sign and changed it from

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.700
0 to 2*pi.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.150
That's where that came from.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.180
And then you end up having
to just determine what y is

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.140
and what dx are,
in terms of theta.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.360
Which we had them already
in terms of theta,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.320
so we could just explicitly
determine everything,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.270
do all the substitution and
then evaluate the integral.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.390
So then, that's all
there is to this problem.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.140
So hopefully that
taught you a little more

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.056
about Green's theorem.

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:26.084
And actually, now
you've done problems

00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:28.750
going from the left to the right
and from the right to the left.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.250
So you've done a
little bit of both.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.790
So hopefully this
revealed a little bit more

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.980
to you than you knew before.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.482
That's where I'll stop.
