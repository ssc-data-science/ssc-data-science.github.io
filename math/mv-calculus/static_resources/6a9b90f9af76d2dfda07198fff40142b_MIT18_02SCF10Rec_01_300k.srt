JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,720
Welcome to recitation.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
In lecture, you started learning
about vectors.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,620
Now vectors are going to be
really important throughout

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,370
the whole of this course.

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,200
And I wanted to give you one
problem just to work with them

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,070
in a slightly different context
than what we're going

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,960
to do in the future.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,010
So this is the context of
Euclidean geometry.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,890
So some of you have probably
seen this problem that we're

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,730
going to solve, but you probably
haven't seen it

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,910
solved with vectors.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,470
So let's take a look at it.

15
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,330
So what I'd like you to do is
show that the three medians of

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,080
a triangle intersect at a point,
and the point is 2/3 of

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,370
the way from each vertex.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,780
So let me just remind you
of some terminology.

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,830
So in a triangle, a median is
the segment that connects one

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,890
vertex to the midpoint
of the opposite side.

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,630
So here, this point M is exactly
halfway between B and

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,810
C.

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,260
So OK.

24
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,070
So every triangle has three
medians-- one from each vertex

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,500
connected to the midpoint of the
opposite side-- and what

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,590
I'm asking you to show is that
these three medians all

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,850
intersect in the same point.

28
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,380
And also, that this point
divides the median into two

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,200
pieces, and the big piece
is twice as large

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,970
as the small piece.

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,530
So this is 2/3 of the median,
and this is 1/3 of the median.

32
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,520
So, why don't you take a few
minutes, work that out-- try

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,610
and do it using vectors
as much as possible--

34
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,200
pause the video, come
back, and we

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,450
can work on it together.

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:39,080

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,320
So hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,460
Let's get started on it.

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,710
So to start, I actually want
to rephrase the question a

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,110
little bit.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,910
And I'll rephrase it to an
equivalent question that's a

42
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,250
little bit more clear about how
we want to get started.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,450
So another way to say this
problem is that it's

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,850
asking us to show--

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,820
so for each median, say this
median AM here, where M is the

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,110
midpoint of side BC--

47
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,560
there exists a point on the
median that divides it into a

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,430
2:1 ratio, so the point that's
2/3 from the vertex to the

49
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
midpoint of the opposite side.

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,910
So for example, you know,
there's a point--

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,070
so, let's call it P,
say, at first--

52
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,020
so there's a point P such
that AP is twice PM.

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,430
OK?

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,490
And similarly, there's some
point-- maybe called Q--

55
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,110
that's 2/3 of the way from B to
the midpoint of this side.

56
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,220
And there's some point that's
2/3 of the way from C to the

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,450
midpoint of this side.

58
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,400
And so an equivalent formulation
of the question is

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,180
to show that these
three points are

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,890
really the same point.

61
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,880
That they're all in
the same place.

62
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,060
So one way we can do that is
that we can compare the

63
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,590
position vectors of those
three points.

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,490
And if those three points all
have the same position vector,

65
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,800
then they're all in exactly
the same position.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,820
So in order to do that
we need some origin.

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,220
And it happens that for this
problem, it doesn't matter

68
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,590
where the origin is, and so
I'm not going to draw an

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,770
origin, but I'm going
to call it O.

70
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,300
So we're going to set up a
vector coordinate system with

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:24,180
origin O. And now I want to look
at what the vector from O

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,600
to P is in terms of the vectors
connecting O to A, B,

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,420
and C. Right?

74
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,360
Those are the vectors
that determine the

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,530
vertices of the triangle.

76
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,970
And so I want to relate the
location of P to the locations

77
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,620
of A, B, and C.

78
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,340
So the first thing
to do is that--

79
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,220
well, in order to talk about
where P is, I know how P is

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,770
related to A and M and I know
how M is related to B and C.

81
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,290
So let's first figure out what
the position vector of M is in

82
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,920
terms of the position vectors
of A, B, and C, and then we

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:03,240
can use that to figure out
the position vector of P.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,260
So M is the midpoint
of the segment BC.

85
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,110

86
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,670
So I think we saw
this in lecture.

87
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:22,232
What this means is that the
position vector OM is exactly

88
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:27,490
the average of the position
vectors of B and C. It's 1/2

89
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,450
of the quantity OB plus OC.

90
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,930
All right?

91
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,510
So it's easy to express the
position vector of the

92
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,930
midpoint of a segment in
terms of the position

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,280
vectors of the endpoints.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,720
You just add the position
vectors of the endpoints and

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,970
divide by 2.

96
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,700
So if you like, this is
equivalent to the geometric

97
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,100
fact that the diagonals of a

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,470
parallelogram bisect each other.

99
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,340
So that's the position
vector of M.

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,490
Now we have to figure out what
the position vector of P is.

101
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,780
So in order to do this we can
note, that in order to get

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,250
from the origin to point P,
well, what we have to go from

103
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,750
the origin-- wherever it is--
to A, and then we have to go

104
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,720
from A 2/3 of the way
to M. All right?

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:29,720
So the vector OP is equal to OA
plus 2/3 of the vector AM.

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,940
Right?

107
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,790
Because we go 2/3 of the way
from A to M in order to get

108
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,430
from A to P. This is because
we've chosen P to be the point

109
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,140
that divides segment AM into
a 2:1 ratio so that

110
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,390
AP is 2/3 of AM.

111
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,000
OK.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,590
So good.

113
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,030
So now we need the vector AM.

114
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,970
Well, we know what the position
vector of A is.

115
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,190
It's just OA.

116
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,500
And we also know what the
position vector of M is.

117
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
It's OM.

118
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,310
So that means that AM is
just the difference

119
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,870
of those two vectors.

120
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,360
It's going to be OM minus OA.

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,950
Another way to say this is that
if you add OA to both

122
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,120
sides, you have that OA
plus AM equals OM.

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,173
In other words, to go from O to
M, first you can go from O

124
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,340
to A, and then go from
A to M. All right.

125
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,410
And I've just subtracted OA
onto the other side here.

126
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,640
So we can write AM in
terms of OM and OA.

127
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,120
And we also, we have an
expression for OM here in

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,290
terms of OB and OC.

129
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,930
So that means we can get an
expression for AM in terms of

130
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,120
OA, OB, and OC.

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,830
So let's do that.

132
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,000
So that's just by substituting
from here into here.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,210
So if I do that, I get that AM
is equal to-- so OM is 1/2 OB

134
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,090
plus 1/2 OC, and now
I just subtract OA.

135
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,685

136
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:04,510
All right.

137
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,790
So that's what AM is, putting
these two equations together.

138
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,830
I get that that's AM.

139
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,100
And so now I need to figure
out what OP is.

140
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
So for OP, I just need to
substitute in this new

141
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,170
expression that I've
got for AM.

142
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:28,000
So I have OP is equal to, well
it's equal to OA plus 2/3 of

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,850
what I've written just
right above--

144
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,860
2/3 of AM.

145
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:40,500
So that's 1/2 OB plus
1/2 OC minus OA.

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,020
OK.

147
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,980
And so now you can multiply this
2/3 in-- you know, just

148
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,170
distribute the scalar
multiplication across the

149
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,300
addition there-- and then
we can rearrange.

150
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,890
We'll have two terms involving
OA and we can combine them.

151
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,280
So we'll see we have a
plus OA minus 2/3 OA.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,450
So that's going to be
equal to 1/3 OA.

153
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,280
And then we have, OK so
2/3 times 1/2 OB.

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,730
So that's plus 1/3
OB plus 1/3 OC.

155
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,680
So this gives us a simple
formula for the position

156
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
vector of P--

157
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,500
that vector OP--

158
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,290
in terms of the position vectors
of A, B, and C. So in

159
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,370
particular, it's actually
because P is the special

160
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,920
point, it's 1/3 of their sum.

161
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,830
Of the sum OA plus OB plus OC.

162
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,010
OK, so that's where P is.

163
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,340
Now to finish the problem, I
just have to show that this is

164
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,460
the same location as
the point that

165
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,470
trisects the other medians.

166
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,940
So how would I do that?

167
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Well, I could go back to my
triangle and I could do

168
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,180
exactly the same thing.

169
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,120
So I could-- maybe I'll give
this point a name, also.

170
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,770
I'll call this midpoint
N, say.

171
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:02,130
So I could let Q be the point
that lies 2/3 of the way from

172
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,290
B to N. And then I could write
down the position vector of N

173
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,320
in terms of OA, OB, and OC.

174
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,460
And then I can use that to write
down the position vector

175
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,400
of Q in terms of OA, OB, and
OC, and I'll get some

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,580
expression.

177
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,390
And what will happen
at the end--

178
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,990
I hope if I'm lucky--

179
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,540
that expression will be equal
to this expression that I

180
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,220
found over here.

181
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,760
OK?

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,540
So you can go through and do
that, and if you do that, what

183
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,210
you'll find is that
in fact it works.

184
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,890
So there's actually a sort
of clever, shorter

185
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,960
way of seeing that.

186
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,730
Which is that this formula is
symmetric in A, B, and C.

187
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,830
So that means if I just relabel
the points A, B, and

188
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,210
C, this expression
for the position

189
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,570
vector doesn't change.

190
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,460
So rather than going through
that process that I just

191
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,730
described, you can also say,
well, in order to look at, say

192
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,830
Q, instead of P, what I need to
do is I just need to switch

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,770
B and A. I need to do exactly
the same thing but the roles

194
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,280
of A and B are interchanged.

195
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,470
Well, if the roles of A and B
are interchanged, then in the

196
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,080
resulting formula, I just have
to interchange the roles of A

197
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,960
and B, but that won't change the
value of this expression.

198
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,020
So by symmetry, the point
I get really is

199
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,170
going to be the same.

200
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,530
If you don't like that argument,
I invite you to go

201
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,840
through this computation
again in the case

202
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,600
of the other medians.

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,340
In either case, what you'll find
is that the points that

204
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,390
trisect the three medians all
have position vector 1/3 OA

205
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,700
plus 1/3 OB plus 1/3
OC, but that means

206
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,230
they're the same point.

207
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:44,680
So what we've shown then, is
that the points that trisect

208
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,290
the three medians-- that
trisect-- that divide them

209
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,000
into 2:1 ratios from the vertex
to the midpoint of the

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,440
opposite side, that those three
points all have the same

211
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,390
position vector.

212
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,850
So in fact, they're the same
point, and that's what we

213
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,390
wanted to show, right?

214
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,900
We wanted to show that there's
one point that trisects all

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,380
three of those medians.

216
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,170
So we've shown that the three
points that trisect them are

217
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,480
actually the same.

218
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,530
So that's the same conclusion,
phrased differently.

219
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,120
So I think I'll end there.

220
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,406
