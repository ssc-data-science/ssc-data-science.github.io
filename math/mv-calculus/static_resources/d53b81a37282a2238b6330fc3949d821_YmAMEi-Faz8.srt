1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,880
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,550
Which is we begin with a
vector field, capital F,

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,270
that is z*x*i plus
z*y*j plus x*k.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,080
And we're going to
look at the curve

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,260
C that is a helix, that we can
describe by the parameter t.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,042
So we'll describe it as
cosine t comma sine t comma t.

8
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,500
And we're interested
in the portion

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,864
of the helix that goes from
(1, 0, 0) to (minus 1, 0, pi).

10
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:40,030
And I'd like you to do two
things with this problem.

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,570
The first thing
I'd like you to do

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,050
is I'd like you to sketch
the curve that is carved out

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,480
when you follow the t
values that will start you

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,580
at (1, 0, 0) and will finish
you up at (minus 1, 0, pi).

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,410
The second thing I
would like you to do

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,110
is I would like you to compute
the line integral F dot dr

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,200
over that portion of the helix.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,270
So there are two
parts to this problem.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,684
Why don't you pause the video,
work on these two parts,

20
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,350
and then when you're
feeling comfortable

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,559
seeing the solution,
bring the video back up

22
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,850
and I'll show you how I did it.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,410
OK, welcome back.

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,826
So again what we're interested
in doing in this problem is

25
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,960
first, understanding
what the curve looks

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,160
like that we want to take
this line integral over.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,800
And then actually computing
the line integral.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,990
So we have this
C that is a helix

29
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,810
and it's described by
cosine t, sine t, t.

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,780
And in fact-- well, I won't
say any more about this helix.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,250
But it actually
should remind you

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,260
when you see the picture of some
portion of what DNA looks like.

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,610
It's going to spiral
around, just the way

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,570
some little side of-- if you
take DNA, how it spirals up,

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,800
it's going to be the
boundary of some of that.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,540
So we'll see that momentarily.

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
And if you notice, the
first thing that's helpful

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,400
if you want to
sketch the curve, is

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,300
that t-- I know immediately
what the parameters are in t.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,120
t is ranging from 0 to pi.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,940
So I know already exactly
what I want to do.

42
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,210
And in order to draw this
curve, what I'm going to do

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,090
is I'm going to give myself
a frame of reference.

44
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,300
Because otherwise
it's going to be

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,630
really hard to draw this curve.

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,770
And the frame of reference
is the following.

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,070
All of these points, all
of the points cosine t,

48
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,250
sine t, t, lie-- in the x-y
distance from the origin,

49
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,530
they lie at a radius 1.

50
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,180
So in terms of x
and y, they're all

51
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,610
going to sit on the boundary
of a cylinder of radius 1.

52
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,614
So let me draw
what I mean by that

53
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,280
and then we'll see
where the points are.

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,710
So let me actually come
write right over here.

55
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,970
So my first part
sketching the curve,

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,810
the first thing I'm going to
do is give myself a cylinder.

57
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,840
Which I'll show you is
of radius 1 momentarily.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,510
And I'm going to actually say
this is the z-axis, coming

59
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,830
straight through the middle.

60
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,830
And then the y-axis is going
to come out the side, as usual.

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,140
And the x-axis is going to
come down in this direction.

62
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,010
OK, so this cylinder I'm
thinking of, it has radius 1.

63
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,420
So at any given z
value, any fixed z

64
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,550
value that I intersect
with the cylinder gives

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,450
a circle of radius 1.

66
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,050
Now if you notice
again, what I was

67
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,360
trying to explain
from over here,

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,530
is that if I don't look at
the z component, obviously

69
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,270
the cosine t, sine
t is something

70
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,050
that's on the unit circle
if I ignore the z component.

71
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,090
And so that's how I know that
these x and y values here

72
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,120
are just going to
lie on the cylinder,

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,060
because they're always
distance 1 from the z-axis,

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,180
at any given height.

75
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,400
So that's the first
thing I observe.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,370
The second thing I observe
is that I mentioned

77
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,920
t goes from 0 to pi, and that's
exactly the z values also.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,690
So the z values are
going from 0 to pi,

79
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,870
so I know my first value is
going to be on the xy-plane.

80
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,250
And my last value is going to
be on the z equals pi plane.

81
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,190
And then the last
thing to observe

82
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,920
is that what is being carved
out in the x and y components?

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,830
Well, it's really
exactly what you

84
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,884
would do if you were trying
to parameterize a circle.

85
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,300
But you're
parameterizing a circle

86
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,841
and instead of just
drawing it always

87
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,230
on the same z
plane-- so xy-plane,

88
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,970
z equals a constant-- you're
parameterizing that circle

89
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,540
and you're also moving up.

90
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,150
And so the first value (1, 0,
0) is happening somewhere here.

91
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,170
And the last value is
happening at negative 1, 0, pi.

92
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,450
And so I have to go sort of
in the backwards direction.

93
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,430
So here's my x equals
negative 1, 0, pi.

94
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,802
And so I'm kind of behind.

95
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,260
You should think
of this as being--

96
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,134
let me see if I can draw
this-- this is behind the pi--

97
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,800
maybe I should draw
it a little further.

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,540
If this is the pi height, it
was more like right there.

99
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,582
It's behind the z-axis here.

100
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:02,540
It's on the other side.

101
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,869
And so the curve
that's carved out

102
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,410
is going to look
something like this.

103
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,200
It's going to come
up through here.

104
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,930
It's spiraling.

105
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,820
And then it's
going to go behind,

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,220
on the other side of the
cylinder, and spiral up.

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,470
Now in a perfect world, if
I could draw this actually

108
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,230
in three dimensions, the way
it's coming up is actually,

109
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,200
it has to have some
sort of constant rate.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,390
Because it's always
moving in the z direction

111
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,640
at a constant rate.

112
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,197
It's moving in the z
direction linearly.

113
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:31,280
Maybe this picture is not
the most perfect picture

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,260
because it looks like it's
going up really fast at the end.

115
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,040
But it gives us a feel
for how the curve looks.

116
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,730
If I continued it, it would
come back around to the front

117
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,650
by the time t went to 2*pi.

118
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,920
And so this is a spiral.

119
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
It goes around the cylinder,
behind the cylinder.

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,207
And then if I go for
another pi, from pi to 2*pi,

121
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,790
it's going to go-- continue to
curve around and then come back

122
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,520
out to the front and be
right above this point.

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,780
So that's the helix.

124
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,610
That's the shape of the helix.

125
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,400
So this is an
approximate sketch.

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,110
Good thing I said
sketch the curve.

127
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,856
So this is a sketch
of the curve.

128
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,230
And now what we
want to do, again

129
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,430
as I mentioned, is we want
to compute a line integral,

130
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,030
we want to compute F
dot dr over this curve.

131
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,250
So what I'm going
to need is I'm going

132
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,620
to know that this
is the curve here,

133
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,510
and I need to understand how to
parameterize F and dr in terms

134
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,976
of this parameter t.

135
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,350
So that's what
I'm interested in.

136
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,270
So let's think about what F
dot dr is in order to do this.

137
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,350
I think the notation
you've seen from lecture

138
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,940
is F we usually denote by
capital P, capital Q, capital

139
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,740
R. And dr we denote
[dx, dy,  dz].

140
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,020
And so F dot dr, as
we've seen previously,

141
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,580
is P*dx plus Q*dy plus R*dz.

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,270
So let's see what that is
in the parameters we have.

143
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,890
So let me first
remind ourselves, x

144
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,570
in this situation is cosine t.

145
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,040
y is sine t.

146
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,490
And z is equal to t.

147
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,400
Based on how we're
parameterizing the curve.

148
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,720
And we're interested in the
values of t going from 0 to pi.

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,510
So these are the quantities
that we're going to need.

150
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,760
Now in order to solve this
problem I need dx, dy, dz.

151
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,772
I also need P, Q, and R in terms
of these x, y, and z values.

152
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,230
So let me remind you also--
I'm going to write it over here

153
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:38,792
so I don't have to look again--
F is actually z*x comma z*y

154
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,340
comma x.

155
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,410
Let me check that.

156
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,920
Yes, that is what I have.

157
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,565
So that is my F. So now that
I have it a little closer,

158
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm going to put
it all together.

159
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,106
And I actually have to move
over to put it together,

160
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,950
but now the reference is closer.

161
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,740
So notice first I'm
going to do P*dx.

162
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,550
So P is z times x.

163
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,240
And then what is dx?

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,670
Well, dx-- I really need to
figure out what dx/dt is,

165
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,020
right? dx/dt is negative sine t.

166
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,490
And so I'm going to replace
the dx by a negative sine t dt.

167
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,860
I'll be replacing
dy by cosine t dt

168
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,004
and I'll be replacing dz by dt.

169
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,670
So I have all the pieces here; I
just have to put them together.

170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,450
So let me do that.

171
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,220
I want to integrate over C
F dot dr. I'm really going

172
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,420
to be integrating-- let's see.

173
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,320
Let me come to this side so
I can see everything I need.

174
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm really going
to be integrating--

175
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,710
I know I'm integrating from
0 to pi in my parameter t.

176
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,560
My first component of
F I told you was z*x.

177
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,810
So that's t cosine t, and
then dx is, as I said,

178
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,680
negative sine t dt.

179
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,150
So times negative sine t dt.

180
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,920
That's my first component.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,200
My next component,
as I said, is Q*dy.

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Q was z*y and so it's t sine t.

183
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,540
And then dy is cosine t dt.

184
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,254
Oops, let me put the dt
there, it's a little easier.

185
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,420
And then I'm going to write
the last component here,

186
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,300
so we can see it
all in one frame.

187
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
And then the last
thing was R*dz.

188
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,080
And R is just x.

189
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,850
So that's cosine t.

190
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,234
And dz is just dt.

191
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,400
So there's three components.

192
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,880
This was the P*dx component,
this is the Q*dy component,

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,840
and this is the R*dz component.

194
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,390
And so notice, this is great.

195
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,681
This is why I like this
problem, it's going to be nice.

196
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,940
Because I've got a t cosine
t times negative sine t,

197
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,250
and a t sine t times a cosine t.

198
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,600
And so these two add
up to 0, and so I only

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,080
have to integrate one thing.

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,710
So I only have to integrate
from 0 to pi cosine t dt.

201
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
And so what do I get?

202
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,720
I get-- this should be sine
t evaluated at 0 and pi.

203
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,980
And sine of pi I believe is 0.

204
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,830
And sine of 0 I believe is 0.

205
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,050
And so I get 0
minus 0, so I get 0.

206
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,480
So they're actually--
when I compute

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,050
the line integral of F
dot dr over that helix,

208
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,747
I actually get 0.

209
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,330
So let me just remind
you, real quick,

210
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,010
what the point of the
problem was and what we did.

211
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,490
We had-- at the very beginning,
we had a vector field,

212
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,872
we had a curve, and
essentially all we were doing

213
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:38,330
is a problem we've done in two
dimensions many times, which

214
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,470
is compute a line
integral along a curve.

215
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,330
And so we just
added a dimension.

216
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,910
The problem is exactly the same.

217
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,750
Instead of now just dx and dy,
now we have a dx, dy, and a dz.

218
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,400
We have one extra
direction you're moving.

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,302
But that's all that's different.

220
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,260
So the first thing we
did was sketch the curve.

221
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,343
Then we computed the line
integral, as I'm saying,

222
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:00,190
by exactly the same methods
that we did in two dimensions.

223
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,010
So everything, really,
should remind you

224
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,020
of what you've done
previously, we now just

225
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,720
have a third component
we have to deal with.

226
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,530
And that was, in our case, in
this problem, the R*dz part.

227
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,506
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
