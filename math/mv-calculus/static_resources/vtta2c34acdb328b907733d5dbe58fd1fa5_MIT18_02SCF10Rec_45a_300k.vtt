00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.760
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.390
In this video what I'd like
you to do is use Green's

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.740
theorem to find the area
between one arch of the

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.080
cycloid that is described by x
equals a times the quantity

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.450
theta minus sine theta, y equals
a times the quantity 1

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.450
minus cosine theta,
and the x-axis.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.910
So probably it's helpful for you
to draw a picture of this

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.280
first. So you have one arch of
the cycloid defined in terms

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.060
of theta, the x of theta and y
of theta are here, and then

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
the x-axis will be
the other bound.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.780
And the big thing I want you to
notice is you're going to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.100
use Green's theorem
to find the area.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.920
So why don't you pause the
video, work on the problem,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.950
when you're ready to see my
solution you can bring the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.200
video back up.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.990
OK, welcome back.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.570
So again, what we want to do
is we want to use Green's

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.870
theorem to find an area.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.970
OK, and what I'm going to do
first is I'm going to try and

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.740
figure out what the picture
looks like and then I'm going

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.860
to figure out how
to use Green's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.450
theorem in this region.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.060
So lets first draw a sketch
of the picture of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.020
what's going on.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.070
And because I want the area
between one arch of the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.960
cycloid and the x-axis, what I
really want to do first is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.400
figure out what theta values
will make y positive, or

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.580
greater than or equal to
0, and go from there.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.380
So if I want y to be greater
than or equal to 0, then what

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.560
I need is 1 minus cosine
theta to be greater

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.390
than or equal to 0.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.790
And that's going to happen for
every theta from 0 to 2 pi,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.200
and at 0 and 2 pi I get 0.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.890
So we know we want theta to
go between 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.510
Those are good parameters to
have for theta because this

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.240
statement is always true, but
I get 0 when theta is 0 and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.500
when theta is 2 pi.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.905
So I'm going to let theta
run between 0

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.490
and 2 pi, as I mentioned.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.870
So now let's think about
what the picture is.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.685
When theta is 0, if I come
over to what x is, x is a

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:12.380
times 0 minus 0.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.600
So x is 0 and y we said was 0.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.560
I know that I'll achieve a
maximum height at theta equal

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.110
pi because that's where cosine
theta is minus 1.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.440
So the 1 minus cosine
theta is 2.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.230
And so if you look at what the
y value will be, the y value

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.000
when theta is pi is 2a.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.850
And the value is going to be
a times pi minus sine pi.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.000
Well, sine of pi is 0.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.270
So I just get a pi.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.790
So I should go over a pi.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.670
And I know there's a point
at a pi, comma, I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.920
think I said 2a.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.590
And then it's actually going
to come back down the same

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.330
way, so let me draw
the first part.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.870
This is not a perfect
drawing of this.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.000
I don't have lots of points.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030
I'm having the smallest amount
of points possible to figure

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.190
out what's happening.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.360
So then when theta is 2 pi,
1 minus cosine theta is 0.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.770
So I get y equals 0.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.020
And then here I get 2 pi
minus sine of 2 pi.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.640
Sine of 2 pi is 0,
so I get 2 pi a.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.290
So I come all the way over
here and I get 2 pi a.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.160
Yeah, that's not maybe the most
beautiful picture, but

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.480
it's a good start.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.490
So I'm interested in finding
the area of this region.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.790
What I want to do then is, to
find the area of that region

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.650
I'm going to use Green's
theorem.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.260
That's what we asked
you to do.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.220
So what I want to do is I want
to pick a curve that's going

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.110
to have 2 components.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.630
It's going to have C1, will be
this bottom part, and C2 will

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.670
be this top part.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.240
And we need to keep it oriented
so when I'm walking

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.800
along the curve the region
is on the left.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.200
And then I have to figure out
how to use Green's theorem.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.250
So to find the area of this
region, all I actually need is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.610
the integral over the
region of dA.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.270
That would give me the area.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.520
And so what quantities--

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.300
what functions would be good?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.940
Sorry.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.330
In order to find this.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.930
Well, I believe you actually
saw in class that

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.670
you have two options.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.990
You have minus y dx over the
closed curve, or you have x dy

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.680
over the closed curve.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.320
You have one of those
two options.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.050
Now which one of those is
better in this case?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.950
We have a choice so let's
make the best choice.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.470
Which one of those is better?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.040
Well, if you notice that on
these two curves x is changing

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.180
on both of them but y is
fixed on this one.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.090
So it'd be nicer for us if we
could just integrate on the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.340
curve on this part, which we
would be able to do if we were

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.510
choosing this one.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.790
Because y is constant and it
is equal to 0 along here.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.810
So what you need to do to solve
this problem is really

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.410
you only need to integrate
on C2 minus y dx.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.010
That's going to give you
the entire area.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.390
And so now we have to figure out
how to put everything in.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.430
Well, C2--

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.940
I'm parameterized in theta--

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.580
and C2 parameterized in
theta, if I start here

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.340
I'm at 2 pi for theta.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.390
And if I go this direction
I'm at 0 for theta.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.620
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do something that

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.930
might seem tricky, but
it's quite natural.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.030
I'm going to replace this
minus by a plus and then

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.590
integrate from 0 to 2 pi.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.570
Because I was going to be
integrating from 2 pi to 0 and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.430
so I just flipped the order
and made that sign a plus.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.690
So that should be fine.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.450
And then y, I already
know what it is.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.990
It's a times 1 minus
cosine theta.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.250
And now I just have to figure
out what is dx.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.370
So we have to come back over,
for one second we're going to

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.980
come over here and we're
going to look at dx.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.370
If x is equal to a times theta
minus sine theta, then dx is

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.590
just a times 1 minus
cosine theta.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.240
So that's nice because that's
actually what we already have.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.510
So we come back over here--

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.790
oh, I should say also
with a d theta--

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.210
come back over here, dx gives
you a squared a, it gives you

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.560
a squared this, and it
gives you a d theta.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.640
So that actually gives you
everything you need.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.560
Now I am not going to actually
write out all the steps in

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.810
order to do this.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.030
But the way you could easily do
this, you can pull out the

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.140
a squared and you're
left with a 1 minus

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.980
cosine theta squared.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.540
You might think about squaring
all the terms and then you

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.990
have 1 cosine squared
theta to deal with.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.340
But ultimately, when you
get your answer--

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.290
I'm just going to write
down what it is--

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.180
you get 3 pi a squared.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.840
And you'll see you get a little
bit of cancellation and

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.460
it's not too hard to solve
at this point.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.290
Since it's single variable
I'm going to assume I

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.500
don't need to do it.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.980
But you can check your
final answer.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.020
You should get--

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.720
I think, yes.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.740
I got 3 pi a squared.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.725
So what we did was we took a
problem, again, where we had a

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:16.040
curve defined in
terms of theta.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.270
We had a curve, and x and y, it
was parameterized in theta.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.340
And we wanted to find
an area between that

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.000
curve and the x-axis.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.360
And the reason we could use
Green's theorem so easily is

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.350
because area of a region--

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.050
of this connected region
here-- is equal to the

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.930
integral over the closed loop
surrounding it of minus y dx,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.060
or alternatively you could
have done x dy.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.200
And because I got to choose,
I picked the easier one.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.300
And I picked the easier one in
this case because y is equal

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.270
to 0 on one part of the curve.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.140
So I just ignored the C1 because
that's where y is 0,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.150
and I looked along C2.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.520
I noticed C2 is parameterized
in this direction from theta

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.080
equals 2 pi to theta equals 0.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.320
So that's why I dropped the
minus sign and changed

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.700
it from 0 to 2 pi.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.150
That's where that came from.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.270
And then you end up having to
just determine what y is and

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.140
what dx are, in terms
of theta.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.660
Which we had them already in
terms of theta, so we could

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.840
just explicitly determine
everything, do all the

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.270
substitution and then evaluate
the integral.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.750
So then, that's all there
is to this problem.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.140
So hopefully that taught
you a little more

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.700
about Green's theorem.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.110
And actually, now you've done
problems going from the left

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.750
to the right and from the
right to the left.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.200
So you've done a little
bit of both.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.200
So hopefully this revealed a
little bit more to you than

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.980
you knew before.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.620
That's where I'll stop.
