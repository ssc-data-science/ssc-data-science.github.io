CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,060
In this video, what
I'd like you to do

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,040
is use least squares to
fit a line to the following

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,210
data, which includes three
points: the point (0, 1),

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,910
the point (2, 1),
and the point (3, 4).

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,050
And I've drawn a rough
picture where these points are

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,100
on a graph, and I'll be
talking a little bit about that

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,880
after you try this problem.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,657
So why don't you try to
solve the problem based

10
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,240
on the technique you
learned in class,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,460
and then bring
the video back up.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,740
I'll show you again what
you're actually doing,

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,990
and then I will also solve
the problem and you can see,

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,490
you can compare
your answer to mine.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,317
OK, welcome back.

16
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,900
So the first thing I want to do
when we're talking about least

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,730
squares to fit a line to these
data, what I'd like to do

18
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,375
is I'm going to
draw a line on here,

19
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,916
and we're going to talk about
what the least squares actually

20
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:02,890
is trying to do.

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,390
And so I'm going to draw this
line, say, something like this.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,700
That's my first
guess on what might

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,730
be the actual least squares
line for these data.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,290
And if you recall, what
you're actually trying to do

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,530
is you're trying to
minimize a certain quantity,

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,770
and the quantity you're
trying to minimize

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,440
is the difference between
the actual value you get

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,920
and the expected value you
get, the square of that.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,120
So this is one thing
we're going to square.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
So even pictorially,
we could say

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,109
we have something that
contributes some area, OK,

32
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,650
and then this is
another thing that's

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,120
the difference between
the expected value in y

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,171
and the actual value you get.

35
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:51,670
So let me try and
make that squared,

36
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,100
because we square that value.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,800
And then this last
one is pretty small.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,680
The difference between
the expected value

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,950
and the actual value is
very small over in this case

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,814
from the picture I drew.

41
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,230
And so what you're
trying to do is

42
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,350
you're trying to
find the line that

43
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,220
minimizes the area of
the sum of these three,

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,020
in this case, three squares.

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,750
So if I, you know, if I tip
the line down further here,

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,600
but I kept it fixed there,
the area of this square

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,160
would get bigger, because this
distance would get bigger.

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,624
But, of course, the area of
this square would get smaller.

49
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,040
And so you're
trying to figure out

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
a way to optimize, in
this case, minimize,

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,180
the area of these--
sorry, the sum

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,230
of the areas of these
squares by figuring out

53
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,310
where to put the line.

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,600
Now, I mentioned if I could
fix this here and move it

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,550
up and down, then that
would change the slope

56
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,942
but fix the intercept.

57
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:45,942
But I could also move the
intercept up and down,

58
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,830
and I could slide
the line up and down,

59
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,980
and that would fix the slope
but vary the intercept,

60
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,022
or I could do both.

61
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,730
And ultimately, that's
what you're doing.

62
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,720
You're trying to find the best
y-intercept and the best slope

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,790
at the same time, and that's
why you learned this process

64
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,150
in multivariable
calculus, because you're

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,920
trying to optimize
something that has two

66
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,580
quantities that you can change.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,780
You can change slope and you
can change the y-intercept,

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,510
so that's why you
learned it now instead

69
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,290
of in single-variable calculus.

70
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,180
Now, if we come over
here, I wrote down ahead

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,590
of time what the equations
are you get when you optimize,

72
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,430
when you're trying to optimize
the least squares line.

73
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,150
So if you write down,
you know, the function

74
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,610
as a function of
a and b, and you

75
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,350
take the derivative
with respect to a

76
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,365
and you set it equal to zero,
you get the first equation.

77
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,930
When you take the
derivative with respect

78
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,420
to b and you set
it equal to zero,

79
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,980
you get the second equation.

80
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,020
And so I'm just going
to fill in the details

81
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,790
and then tell you
what the solution is,

82
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,820
and then I'm going to mention a
little more sophisticated thing

83
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,670
we can do, or I guess
maybe the next level

84
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,240
of least squares we can do,
that's not a linear problem.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,870
So I'll do that last.

86
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,650
So what I want to do is I put
all the values I need over here

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,420
on the right.

88
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,211
So all the values we
need are on the right.

89
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,780
We're going to need the sum
of all the x_i's and that's 5.

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,565
The sum of all the y_i's is 6.

91
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,345
The sum of the x_i
squareds is 13,

92
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:12,736
and the sum of the
x_i*y_i product is 14.

93
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,110
Now, where are
these coming from?

94
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,780
Remember, what is
x_i and what is y_i?

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,580
If we come back over here,
this is (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2),

96
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,330
(x_3, y_3), OK?

97
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,830
So that's sort of how we get--
if we switch the whole pairs

98
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,120
around, it doesn't matter.

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Obviously, if we switched
x- and y-values together,

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,900
it does matter, and that you
see actually from the equation

101
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
does matter.

102
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,850
Right here you have
a product of them.

103
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,450
So let me write this out.

104
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,270
And again, we're solving for
a and b, so in this case,

105
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,830
a is the slope and b is
the intercept, right?

106
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,080
So let me write everything in.

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,640
So we actually get that we want
to solve the following system:

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:00,800
13a plus 5b is equal to 14.

109
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,380
Make sure I put in
everything correctly.

110
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,570
And then the second one is
5a plus-- n in this case

111
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,130
is 3, because there were three
points-- plus 3b is equal to 6.

112
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,930
OK, this is a
system of equations.

113
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,180
It has two equations
and two unknowns,

114
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,480
and if you solve this-- I
should look at my notes,

115
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
because I didn't
memorize it and I'm not

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,620
going to do all the algebra.

117
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,230
If you go to solve this,
what you actually get

118
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,780
is that a is equal to 6/7
and b is equal to 4/7.

119
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,470
So you get that the line--
let me write it here.

120
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:45,590
You get a is equal to 6/7
and b is equal to 4/7, OK?

121
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,720
And so what that tells you is
if you come back over here,

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,410
the line we actually want-- I'll
write the solution right here--

123
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:59,551
the line we actually want is the
line y equals 6/7 x plus 4/7.

124
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,717
That is our least squares
line that is our solution.

125
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,930
OK?

126
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,990
So that is actually-- solving
for a line to fit these data,

127
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,514
you get the following solution.

128
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,680
But I want to point out,
and what we're going to do,

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,780
after this video there will be
a challenge problem, to have

130
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,502
you actually finish this.

131
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,210
I want to point out
that you can actually

132
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,040
also fit a higher-degree
polynomial to these data.

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,840
For instance, you
could try and use

134
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,360
the technique of least
squares to fit a parabola

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,267
to these data.

136
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,100
And let me point out
what the function would

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,820
look like in this case.

138
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,470
So this is for the
challenge problem.

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,380
For the challenge
problem, it now

140
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,320
will be a function
of three variables,

141
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,820
so it will look
something like this.

142
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,470
We'll say a comma b comma
c, and the point that we'll

143
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,450
be wanting to minimize,
or the function

144
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,720
we'll be wanting to minimize,
we're summing over i, again

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,860
from 1 to 3-- I didn't
write that down above,

146
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,340
but it was fairly
obvious that that

147
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,000
was what we were summing
over-- the following thing.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,110
We have y_i minus
this big quantity:

149
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:15,820
a x_i squared plus b*x_i plus c
and we square the whole thing.

150
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,430
And so what this
is actually giving

151
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,090
you is, just as in
the picture before,

152
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,465
this is giving
you the difference

153
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,720
between the expected value
and the actual value.

154
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,040
So this is your actual y-value,
and based on the parabola

155
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,940
you're looking for,
what's in parentheses is

156
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,830
your expected y-value, right?

157
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,330
So this would actually
be my parabola.

158
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,720
When I evaluate it at
x_i, I get a number.

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,330
I get a value, and that value
will be on the parabola.

160
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,870
This will be the
y-value associated

161
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,550
to the x-value from the data.

162
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,720
So this is the actual value.

163
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,390
This is the expected value.

164
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,280
We take the difference
and square it.

165
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,960
And because we want
to minimize how

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,360
we're going to
solve this problem

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,470
and this is what
you'll have to do

168
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,660
is, just like with
the line situation,

169
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,880
you're going to take the
derivative of this function

170
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,800
with respect to each of these
three variables separately.

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,020
So you'll take f sub a, and then
you'll set that equal to zero.

172
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,224
And then you'll take f sub b,
you'll set that equal to zero.

173
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,890
And then you'll take
f sub c, and you'll

174
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,870
set that equal to zero.

175
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,460
Again, we set them
all equal to zero,

176
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,650
because this is really
an optimization problem.

177
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,040
We want to minimize something.

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,530
We want to minimize
this quantity.

179
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,217
So you take each of
those three derivatives,

180
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,050
partial derivatives,
set them equal to zero,

181
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,440
and you have a system of three
equations with three variables.

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,960
And you know how to solve such
a system, by using matrices,

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,680
for instance.

184
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,840
That would be one way
to solve such a system.

185
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,410
And so then you can
actually come up

186
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:46,860
with a formula for the sort
of parabola of best fit,

187
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,320
you could think of it as.

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,920
And so I'm going to stop there,
because I think from here,

189
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,250
you guys will do it.

190
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,680
But I just want
to point out this

191
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,442
is where you're
going to be starting

192
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,900
this next sort of
challenge problem

193
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,900
to find the quadratic of
best fit for these three data

194
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,930
points.

195
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,511
So that's where I'll end it.
