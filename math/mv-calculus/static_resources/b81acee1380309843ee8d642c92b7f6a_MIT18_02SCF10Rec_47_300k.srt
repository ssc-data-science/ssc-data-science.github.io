CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,650
In this video, I'd like us to
see how geometric methods can

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,220
help us understand the flux of a
vector field across a curve.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,980
So in particular, what we're
going to do is try and use

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,400
geometric methods to compute
the flux of four different

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,140
vector fields F across curve
C. So I've labeled them for

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,870
later purposes.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,010
I've labeled them F1,
F2, F3, and F4,

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,960
and they are as follows.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,080
F sub 1 is the vector field that
is a scalar function of

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,940
only the radius times the
vector x comma y.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,260
And the curve I'm interested
in in this

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,440
part is the unit circle.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,390
The second one, part b, is the
vector field that is g of r.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,990
Again, where g is a scalar
function and r is the radius--

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,010
so it depends only
on the radius--

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,410
times the vector minus y, x.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,470
And again the C will
be the unit circle.

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,550
The third and fourth ones, we
use a different C, but they

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,720
will be the same there.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,590
I'll point that out.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,660
So in the third one, the vector
field is 3 times the

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,970
vector (1, 1).

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,350
And C in this case will be
the segment connecting

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,470
(0, 0) to (1, 1).

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,740
So it's a piece of the
line y equals x.

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,500
And then in part d, F will be
3 times the vector (-1, 1).

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,510
And C is, again, this segment
from (0, 0) to (1, 1).

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,490
So again, what I'd like you to
do is rather than trying to

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,740
parametrize the curve and do
the entire calculation, I'd

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,480
like to see you try and
understand the relationship

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,950
between each of these factor
fields F and the normal to the

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,540
curve that they're on.

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,310
And see if you can figure out
the flux based on that

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,590
relationship.

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,930
So why don't you pause the
video, give that a shot, and

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,610
then when you're ready to see
how I did it, you can bring

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,860
the video back up.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:01,030

41
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,160
OK, welcome back.

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,240
Again, I'm going to try and use
my geometric intuition to

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,140
understand what the flux is for
each of these four vector

44
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,020
fields along these
four curves.

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,530
So what I'd like to do is
if I'm going to try and

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,840
understand geometrically what's
happening, it's always

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,130
good to draw a picture.

48
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,630
So I'm going to draw a picture
that I'll use for a and b, and

49
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,350
then I'll draw another picture
later that I'll

50
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,690
use for c and d.

51
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,970
So notice again in a, my curve
is the unit circle.

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,670
And I have a somewhat explicit
understanding of what the

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,440
vector fields are.

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,880
So I'm going to draw the unit
circle and see if I can figure

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,750
out where F1 and F2 are.

56
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,330

57
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,280
It's not a perfect unit circle,
but it looks sort of

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,340
like the unit circle.

59
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,540
So this is going to
be my unit circle.

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,600
And what I want to point out
first is that I was not trying

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,700
to trick you, but just to help
you notice, that in a and b,

62
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,130
they both depended on this
radial function.

63
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,270
But the radius on the unit
circle is fixed at 1.

64
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,390
So in both of these vector
fields, it will

65
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,500
simply be g of 1.

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,340
So that will be a
constant value.

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,760
So all that's giving me is
some scalar multiple of

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,080
whatever the length
of this one is.

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,470
So it's this direction times
this scalar g of 1.

70
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,250
One other thing I want to point
out is that both of

71
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,040
these vectors, F1 and F2, if I
ignore the g part, and I look

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,570
at just the x comma y and the
minus y comma x, is these

73
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,080
parts have unit length.

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,500
And you should be able to see
that right away, because x and

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,780
y are on the unit circle.

76
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,650
And so the length of the vector
whose tail is at the

77
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,190
origin and head is on
the edge of the unit

78
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,550
circle has length 1.

79
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,790
And then you can easily see
that this vector and this

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,320
vector have the same length,
because their individual

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,920
components are the same
absolute value.

82
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,520
We already understand a
few things about F1

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,910
and F2 right away.

84
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,770
That all the length is coming
from this g, and g is fixed

85
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,430
all the way around the unit
circle at g of 1.

86
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,330
Now let's figure out what the
flux is for these two things.

87
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,520
So if you notice first, F sub
1 is the vector (x, y) times

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,190
the scalar g of 1.

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,770
So if I come over here,
I want to point out--

90
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,250
I'll do this part in
white first-- that

91
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,360
if I'm at this point--

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,080
this is the point (x, y)--

93
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,210
the vector (x, y) is equal
to this vector.

94
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,190
So if I think about putting
that at this point--

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm going to draw it here--

96
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,120
I get something that
looks like this.

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,820
So this is F sub 1, probably.

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,180
I'm going to have to make
one comment about that.

99
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,700
But notice, this should
look like

100
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,460
it's all in one direction.

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,600
So this is the vector (x, y).

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,900
If I slide it so its tail is
here, it's again in the same

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,800
direction, and now I've just
scaled it by g of 1.

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Now, this is assuming,
obviously,

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,560
that g of 1 is positive.

106
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
So we're going to assume that
throughout this problem.

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,740
I'll mention what happens when
g is negative at the end.

108
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,060
So this is my vector F sub 1.

109
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,500
Let's think about what is the
normal to this curve.

110
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,600
The normal to this curve,
actually at each point on the

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
circle, points in exactly the
same direction as F sub 1.

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,480
Because if I'm parametrizing
in this direction--

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,620
I'll draw one down here so we
can see what it looks like--

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,490
the normal-- actually, let
me come from there--

115
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,500
the normal is going to look
something like this.

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,830
OK.

117
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,130
So it would be connecting from
the origin to that point on

118
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,790
the circle, and keep going
out in that direction.

119
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,600
That's the normal direction.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,150
So F sub 1, if g is a positive
function, it points in exactly

121
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,410
the same direction
as the normal.

122
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,440
If g is a negative function,
it points in exactly the

123
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,460
opposite direction.

124
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,860
So F1 would be flipped
exactly around if g

125
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,350
was a negative function.

126
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,710
So if I want to compute
the flux for part a--

127
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll do it down here--

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,595
if I want to compute the flux,
remember, I'm taking the

129
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:58,020
integral along the curve
of F dotted with n ds.

130
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,400
Well, F dotted with
n is constant.

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,620
And that's the main
point that's going

132
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,110
to make this easier.

133
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,550
At each point--

134
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,090
I guess I should say F1--

135
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,160
F1 dotted with n is always
equal to the length of F1

136
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,230
times the length of n
times cosine of the

137
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,090
angle between them.

138
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,560
With a very quick calculation,
you can see that winds up

139
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,990
being g of 1.

140
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,720
So the only reason I don't have
to worry about absolute

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,930
value, is if g is positive, I'm

142
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,950
pointing in the same direction.

143
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
If g is negative, I'm pointing
in the opposite direction.

144
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,550
And so the cosine theta is minus
1 instead of plus 1.

145
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,960
You might want to check that
for yourself, but this

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,320
is just g of one.

147
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,380
So that's a constant.

148
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,150
So this is actually equal
to g of 1 times the

149
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,820
integral over C of ds.

150
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,960
Now, what is this?

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,250
If I integrate this, I should
pick up exactly the

152
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,120
length of the curve.

153
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,300
OK.

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,200
Because this is the derivative
of arc length, so when I

155
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,090
integrate this, I
get arc length.

156
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,490
But it's a unit circle, so the
arc length is just the

157
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,960
circumference of the
unit circle.

158
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,500
So that's 2 pi times g of 1.

159
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,312
OK.

160
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:06,150
And that's all you get.

161
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,560
That's it.

162
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,310
So we didn't actually have
to parametrize anything.

163
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,250
We just had to understand F1
relating to the normal.

164
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,360
So I didn't draw the normal
here, but if I take this

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,380
normal and I spin around to
here, the normal is in the

166
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,880
same direction as F sub 1.

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,260
So now let's look at F sub 2.

168
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,200
And let's do this first by
pointing something out about

169
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,750
the relationship between
F sub 2 and F sub 1.

170
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,975
Notice that if I take F sub
1 and I dot it with F

171
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,630
sub 2, I get 0.

172
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:32,900
Right?

173
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,070
Because ignoring even the scalar
part, I get x times

174
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,590
minus y, plus y times
x, which gives me 0.

175
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,640
If the scalars come along for
the ride, I still get 0.

176
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,810
So F sub 1 and F sub
2 are orthogonal.

177
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,970
And in fact--

178
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,460
you can do this for yourself--
but if I come over and draw

179
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,280
the picture, F sub 2 is
going to be F sub 1

180
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,560
rotated by 90 degrees.

181
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,620
Something like this.

182
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,590
This is my F sub 2.

183
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,810
Again, if g of 1 was negative,
F sub 1 would be this

184
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,960
direction, and F sub 2 would
then be around here.

185
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,940
But ultimately, it's not going
to matter in this case whether

186
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,860
g is positive or negative,
because notice what happens.

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,470
If I want to integrate F sub 2
dotted with the normal, notice

188
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,460
the normal is in the same
direction as F sub 1, so F sub

189
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,400
2 dotted with the normal is 0.

190
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,810
So if I'm going to integrate the
function 0 all along the

191
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,000
curve, I shouldn't be surprised
that my answer to

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,410
part b is 0.

193
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,190
So there was even less
work in part b.

194
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,260
Because I immediately had that
F sub 2 is really in the

195
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,740
direction of the tangent
to the curve.

196
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,490
And so I have something in the
direction of the tangent

197
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,150
dotted with something in the
direction of the normal-- in

198
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,410
fact, the normal--

199
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,190
so I get 0.

200
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,430
All right.

201
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,750
So now I'm going to draw a
picture for c and d, and then

202
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,000
we're going to use that one.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,960

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,070
And I have to make sure
I come on this side.

205
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,630
Sorry about that.

206
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,880
So here is (0, 0).

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,110

208
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,100
And here is (1, 1).

209
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,930
Actually, you know what?

210
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,020
I'm going to make it
a little longer.

211
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,160
I might need more room.

212
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,970
So (1, 1) I'll make a
little further up.

213
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,960
OK?

214
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,192
(0, 0) and (1, 1) and
that's my curve.

215
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,260
There's (1, 1).

216
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,240
OK.

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,710
Now, if I parametrize it in
this direction, then I can

218
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,360
draw my normal.

219
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,100
Because it's a line segment, my
normal is constant in its

220
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,030
length and direction.

221
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:39,040
So at any given point, it's
exactly equal to this vector,

222
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,350
up to the right scaling.

223
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,170
And it should be something
like (1, -1) divided

224
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,750
by square root 2.

225
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,430
That's my normal.

226
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,930
If you want it precisely,
that's what it is.

227
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,520
You don't actually need it to
solve this problem, though.

228
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,030
But that's what it is if
you want it precisely.

229
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,260
Now let's look at what F3 is,
and then we'll look at what F4

230
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,780
actually is.

231
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,450
So let's look at F sub 3.

232
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,960
F sub 3 was the vector
3 times (1, 1).

233
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,560
So if we come back to our
picture, at any point on this

234
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,350
curve, if I go in the (1, 1)
direction, I stay parallel to

235
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,600
this curve.

236
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600

237
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,420
I don't want to draw the whole
thing, because it would take

238
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,340
up the entire curve.

239
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,420
It's longer than the
curve itself.

240
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,340
But F sub 3, at any
given point,

241
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,520
points in this direction.

242
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,920
So this is F sub 3, but not
as long as it actually is.

243
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,500
But only the direction is going
to matter in this case.

244
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
So F sub 3 is pointing
in this direction.

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,500
So if I want to compute
the flux, I

246
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,870
dot it with the normal.

247
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,850
But look at what happens.

248
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,580
The normal is orthogonal to
F sub 3 at every point.

249
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,760
And so F sub 3 dotted with
the normal is 0.

250
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,850
And so again, for exactly the
same reason as part b, in part

251
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,960
c, the flux is 0.

252
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,290
So again, it's exactly the same
that the vector field I

253
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,930
was looking at and I wanted to
compute the flux for, is

254
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,460
actually tangent to the
curve at every point.

255
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,050
And so when I dot it to the
normal to the curve at every

256
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,870
point, I get 0.

257
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,420
And so computing
the flux is 0.

258
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,460
So now, I have one more to do,
and that one is part d.

259
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,630
And in this case, F sub 4--

260
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,750
let me just remind you--

261
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,600
is 3 times the vector (-1, 1).

262
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,770
And so if we go back to our
picture here, F sub 4, if I

263
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,320
compare it to the normal, in
fact, what I get is very long.

264
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,850
This is probably not
quite long enough.

265
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,400
But that's at least the
direction of F sub 4.

266
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,120
And so F sub 4 is exactly
the opposite

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,350
direction to the normal.

268
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,580
So if I want to compute the
flux of F sub 4 along this

269
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,440
curve, all I have to understand
is F sub 4 dotted

270
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,120
with the normal and the
length of the curve.

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,600
This is exactly the same type
of solution as part a.

272
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,540
So let's notice this.

273
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,690
First, F sub 4, the length
is 3 root 2.

274
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,610
You can compute that
pretty quickly.

275
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,870
The length of n is just 1.

276
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,510
It's a normal.

277
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,830
That's why this stuff
didn't really matter

278
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,950
what exactly it was.

279
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,710
It's good to know what direction
it points in.

280
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,090
So F sub 4 dotted with n is
exactly 3 root 2 times cosine

281
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,340
of the angle between
n and F sub 4.

282
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,350
The angle is pi.

283
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,610
You notice they differ by
180 degrees, right?

284
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,080
So it's cosine pi,
which is minus 1.

285
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,160
So what I do in part d, is I'm
integrating along the curve

286
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,240
the constant negative
3 square root 2 ds.

287
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,690
This is exactly F sub 4 dotted
with the normal.

288
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,030
And so as before, this is going
to equal to negative 3

289
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,870
root 2 times the arc length.

290
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,130
Because the integral over the
curve ds is going to be the

291
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,590
arc length.

292
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,480
And the arc length is
very easy to see.

293
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,590
You've gone over 1 and up 1.

294
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,970
Right?

295
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,050
So Pythagorean theorem,
understanding right triangles,

296
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,290
however you want to do it,
the length of this

297
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,160
curve is root 2.

298
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,380
So this works out to be negative
3 root 2 root 2,

299
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,210
which is just negative 6.

300
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,450
So let me just remind you, there
were four problems here.

301
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,720
There are two sets of problems,
where in each case,

302
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,560
you have one similar
to the other.

303
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,490
So let me point this out
one more time, and just

304
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,530
sort of step back.

305
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,060
We had a circle, and then
in the next part

306
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,140
we had a line segment.

307
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,410
But in the circle, one of the
problems had the vector in the

308
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,930
direction of the normal, and
you wanted to compute

309
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,760
the flux for that.

310
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,740
And in the other, the vector was
tangent to the curve, and

311
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,205
so it was orthogonal
to the normal.

312
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,620
And you wanted to compute
the flux for that.

313
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,310
Obviously, when you're tangent
to the curve and then

314
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,800
orthogonal to the normal,
you get 0.

315
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,370
And that was the case
for b and for c.

316
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,220
When you're normal to the curve
and of constant length--

317
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,580
which was the case actually
for both a and d--

318
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,810
then all you have to do is find
F dotted with the normal,

319
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,320
and then find the arc length,
and multiply them together.

320
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,010
So that was the real strategy we
had to use for a and for d.

321
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,900
So hopefully, this helps you
see how the geometric

322
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,065
quantities are interacting to
understand the flux of a

323
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:23,200
vector field across a curve.

324
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,340
And that's where I'll stop.

325
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,532
