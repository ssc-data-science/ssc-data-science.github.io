CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:11.110
In this video, what I'd like
us to do is work on

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.600
understanding simply connected
regions in three dimensions.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.080
Well, there's one
two-dimensional one, but the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.620
rest are three dimensions.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.915
So what I want you to do is for
each of the following--

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.440
there are six different
regions--

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.310
determine whether or not each
of them is simply connected.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.290
So the first one is R3.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.000
The second one is if
I take R3 and I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.420
remove the entire z-axis.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.800
The third one is if I take
R3 and I remove 0.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.025
The fourth one is if I take
R3 and remove a circle.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.640
The fifth one is R2 minus
a line segment.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.410
And the sixth one is
a solid torus.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.630
So a solid torus looks like a
doughnut, and it includes the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.770
inside of the doughnut.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.830
This looks like a doughnut,
hopefully, to you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.420
And it's not hollow.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.940
It includes the inside.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.260
So what I'd like you to do,
again, is determine whether or

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.030
not each of these regions
is simply connected.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.560
And why don't you pause the
video while you work on that.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440
And then bring the video back
up when you're ready

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.690
to check your work.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.110
OK, welcome back.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.760
So again, what we're interested
in doing is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.840
understanding simply

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.330
connectedness in another dimension.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.880
We did something already
a while back with two

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.550
dimensions, and so now we want
to understand it better in

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.690
three dimensions.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.950
So let's work through these.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.250
Well, I'm not going to write
anything down for number one,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.530
because you should
already know that

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.220
R3 is simply connected.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.190
But if you weren't sure about
it, you could think, for any

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.570
closed curve I draw in R3, I can
certainly get all of the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.100
inside of it contained in R3.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850
Another way to think about it is
that I can take that curve

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.660
and I can collapse it down to
a point, and remain in R3.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.760
So then the first one is
an easy yes to simply

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.030
connectedness.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.260
OK?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.270
So let's start on the second
one, and I'm going to draw a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.750
little picture for us.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.860
So the second one is R3.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.650
I should go this way.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.020
This is x, y, and z, but then
I remove the entire z-axis.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.510
So I should make this really
dark so we know we're removing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.280
that part from R3.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.240
And I'm removing it all the way
up to minus infinity in

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.840
the z-direction and plus
infinity in the z-direction.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.580
Now, the question is can I find
any closed curve, that

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.920
when I try and compress that
closed curve down to a point,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.820
I can't do it while remaining
inside this region that is all

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.830
of R3 minus the z-axis.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.090
And the answer is there
is a whole family of

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.000
curves that do this.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.940
If I take a curve that goes
around the z-axis, you'll

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.700
notice that there's something
on the inside of it--

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970
regardless, of whether I slide
it up or down-- there's a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.840
point on the inside of this
curve that is not in the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960
region I'm interested in.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.810
The region, again, is
R3 minus the z-axis.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.470
So there are two ways
to think about this.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.200
You can think about if I were to
take this curve and I were

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.690
to put a surface across this
curve so it was like a disk,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.850
there would be a point
on the z-axis that

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.780
would intersect it.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.070
Or you can think about it as
saying, I have this curve and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.990
if I try and squeeze it down to
as small as I can get it, I

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.550
can't get it as small is I
want without hitting the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.010
z-axis at some point.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.930
The z-axis is kind of
in the way, right?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.650
Now, number three is a little
different situation.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.190
Because in number three, I think
this exact same picture,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.340
but instead of removing the
whole z-axis, I just remove

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.940
the origin.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.550
So let me try and draw
a picture of that.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.740
So I'm going to make this a big
open circle at the origin.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.120
That's not included
in our region.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.560
So our region is all of
R3 except the origin.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.520
And in two-dimensional space,
this was not simply connected.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.860
But in three-dimensional space
it is simply connected.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.490
So this is a little different
situation than what you had

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.570
previously.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.820
And so the idea is here, if I
take a curve, even if I take a

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.810
curve that's sitting in the xy
plane that goes around the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.860
origin, the point is I can
keep this curve in

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.980
three-dimensional space, and I
can wiggle it around, so that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.190
I can shrink it down to a point,
and the origin doesn't

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.840
get in the way.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.350
It doesn't keep me
from doing that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.070
So actually, this region, even
though in two-dimensional

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.120
space it was not simply
connected, in

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.620
three-dimensional space it is.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.120
And let's see if we understand
the difference.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.430
The difference is in
two-dimensional space, if I

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.510
drew a curve on the xy plane
around the origin, and I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.010
wanted to squish it down to a
point, the only way to do that

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.120
would be to bring the curve
somehow through the origin.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.380
Right?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.520
I would be stuck having to pass
the curve through the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.090
origin to shrink it
down to a point.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.490
But in three space, I have
another dimension.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.860
So a curve that sits on the xy
plane, I can just kind of lift

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.720
it a little bit away from the
origin, and then I can shrink

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.740
it down to a point without the
origin getting in the way.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.680
So having that extra dimension
means even though I remove one

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.030
point, it's still actually a
simply connected region.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.210
So maybe this is the first place
we see that in the three

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.930
dimensions we have a different
case than we had in two

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.500
dimensions removing the
same kind of object.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.560
So I realize now I haven't
been writing down whether

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.250
these are simply connected
or not.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.640
So I should write down this
is simply connected.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.030
And maybe for number two I
should go back and formally

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.200
write not simply connected.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.880
So that we have this
for posterity.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.910
Now the fourth one is
R3 minus the circle.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.830
So let me see if I can draw
a picture of that.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.100
And for the circle, it doesn't
really matter where it is.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.450
I'm just going to draw
one somewhere.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.930
So here's my circle.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.430
So everything is in my region
except this circle.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.710
And the question: is it
simply connected?

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.670
And the answer is: no, the
region is not simply

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.460
connected, because of one
particular problem.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.500
It's actually the same kind of
problem you have when you

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.010
remove the z-axis.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.610
And that is, if I draw a curve
that goes around this circle--

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.680
any curve that goes around
this circle--

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.870
notice that any way I try and
move this curve and shrink it

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.710
down to a point, this circle is
going to get in the way for

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.110
the same reason that the
z-axis got in the way.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.100
Because this circle is closed,
I can't slide the curve I'm

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.170
interested in away from
the circle and

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.480
then shrink it down.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.300
OK.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.950
There's some sort of obstruction
right here.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.110
And so it's fundamentally
different than the case where

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.000
we just had the origin, because
we could take any

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.610
curve and we could move it away
from the origin, and then

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.800
shrink it down to a point.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.430
And the origin didn't
get in the way.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.930
But here, anywhere I try and
move this curve, it's going to

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.420
have to hit the circle if I want
to move it away so I can

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.320
shrink it to a point
in my region.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.600
So this circle is preventing
me from shrinking it down.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.990
OK, and then there
are two more.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.006
And the fifth one is R2
minus a line segment.

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:23.850
So now we're in two-dimensional
space.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.660
OK, and let me just
pick a segment.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.120
OK.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.010
Now, this one is interesting.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.230
Oops.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.980
Again I did it.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.210
I forgot to write whether it's
simply connected or not.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.890
Let me come back over to
four for posterity.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.410
Not simply connected.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.440
OK, sorry about that.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.960
For the fifth one, because I'm
in two dimensions, it's going

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.370
to be not simply connected,
but if I add a third

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.990
dimension, it would become
simply connected.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.760
So I want to explain why it's
not simply connected here, and

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.920
then I want to show you why in
a third dimension it becomes

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.830
simply connected.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.870
OK?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.270
The problem curves are the
curves that do this, that go

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.400
around this line segment.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.730
Because notice, if I want to
try and contract this curve

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.970
down to a point and I don't want
to intersect that line

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.690
segment, in order to do it I'd
actually have to move it away

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.630
from the line segment.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.410
I'd have to pass through
the line segment.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.310
At some point, this curve would
intersect that segment

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.760
in order to be able to shrink
it to a point in the region

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.900
I'm interested in.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.680
So this segment is getting in
the way-- we can think of it

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.920
that way-- of allowing me to
contract this down to a point.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.540
Actually also, when we talked
about simply connectedness in

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.990
two dimensions, it was easier.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.410
Because we could say, if we take
any curve and we look at

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.700
the disk that's spanned by the
boundary of this curve, and we

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.570
look at the region the curve
encloses, notice that this

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.510
segment is in that region.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.110
And there's no way of drawing
this kind of curve without the

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.980
segment being in that region,
and that's how we know it's

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.830
not simply connected.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.550
Now, in three dimensions,
what happens?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.735
What if I took this exact same
picture and I just made the

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:08.680
z-axis come out from
the board?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.490
Why is that suddenly simply
connected, whereas in the

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.250
two-dimensional case it's not?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.700
And the reason is because in
this same picture, I could

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.610
take this same curve, and I
could take this shaded thing,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.070
and I could push the shaded
thing out of the xy plane.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.900
And so I'd still have the same
boundary curve, but I'd have

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.180
the shaded portion not
hitting the segment.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.530
And so I can find some surface
with this boundary that

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.680
doesn't have this segment in the
interior of the surface.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.400
And that's another way of
thinking about simply

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.480
connectedness.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.790
So in the two-dimensional
case, it is not simply

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.070
connected, but if I were to add
a third dimension, this

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.400
region would become
simply connected.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.660
OK.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.620
Because I would have no problem
for any curve finding

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.610
some surface that had that
curve as a boundary that

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.060
didn't intersect that segment.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.640
So I could keep the surface
in the region I

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.010
was interested in.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:06.290
OK.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.160
So that would tell me it
was simply connected.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.990
And then the last one
is a solid torus.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.250
OK, and this one, we might not
have dealt with solid tori

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.710
before, but this is an
interesting problem.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.490
OK, so there are
fundamentally--

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.890
we say in math-- that there are
two classes of curves that

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.860
are interesting.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.980
We won't get into the exact
terminology of what's

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
happening, but there are two
types of curves on the torus.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.630
One type of curve is the kind
that goes around right here.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:37.970
OK.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.980
So it loops around the doughnut
in that direction.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.220
But that type of curve is nice,
because notice, that if

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.590
I look at the surface in there,
it's all inside the

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.550
solid torus.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.470
So that's good.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:11:00.990
So that seems like that's a
curve that is not telling us

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.200
it's not simply connected.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.670
We'll say that.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.810
But there's another class
of curves in the torus.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.000
And that's the class of curves
that goes around--

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.250
this is a little harder
to draw--

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.640
the top, but around the hole.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.450
OK?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.640
Around the hole.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.740
Now any surface I have
that I try to draw--

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.210
any surface that's
going to have

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.960
that curve as a boundary--

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.650
is at some point forced to
leave the solid torus.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.030
And the reason is really
because of

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.520
the hole in the middle.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:33.780
Right?

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.170
That's really the reason
it happens.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.270
OK.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.250
And so you can see the part
right in here is on the

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.820
surface, but it's not
in the solid torus.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.740
So because I have a curve that
any surface I draw that has

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.090
that curve as a boundary is
forced to leave the solid

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.540
torus, it's a non-simply
connected region.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.870
So we say not simply
connected.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.000
OK.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.680
So I'm going to go back through
real quickly and just

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.160
remind us what was happening.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.300
And maybe use the language
I was using at the end to

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.310
describe the first examples,
because that might help a

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.750
little better.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.290
So let's go back to the
first examples.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.260
OK, in the R3 example, again,
number one, we know it's

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.610
simply connected.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.420
We're not going to
worry about it.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.000
OK.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.490
But let me draw number two.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.090
Maybe if I draw some shaded
region, this will help us

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.270
understand it a little
bit better.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.790
Number two we established was
not simply connected.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.430
And if you think about it, if
you have a curve that goes

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.540
around the z-axis, and you want
to look at a surface that

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.970
has that curve as its boundary,
this surface

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.710
certainly intersects
the z-axis.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.940
The question is, can I keep this
curve the way it is, and

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.910
pull the surface away and have
it not intersect the z-axis?

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.140
And the answer is no.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.150
Any way I move the inside of
the curve-- basically, what

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.360
looks like a disk--

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.120
it's still going to intersect
the z-axis somewhere.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.710
Right?

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.140
And so it's definitely
not simply connected.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.330
And the thing I was trying to
point out in number three is

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.670
that it is simply connected.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.840
If I shade the boundary of a
curve sitting in the xy plane,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.760
and then I take that shaded
disk and I push it up a

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.110
little, then it no longer
hits the origin.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.970
And I haven't fundamentally
changed my curve at all.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.860
And so that's a way of
understanding that it is

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.730
actually simply connected.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:27.970
OK?

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.810
So there are a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.380
And without being incredibly
mathematically precise, these

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.640
are some of the best ways we
have of thinking about

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.930
understanding simply connected
or not simply connected.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.150
So again, we had six examples.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.110
Removing the z-axis from R3
was not simply connected.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:53.120
Removing the origin from R3 was
still simply connected.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.130
Removing a circle from R3 was
not simply connected for the

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:02.740
same reason as the z-axis
problem, because here was my

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.650
disk, and any way I try to move
this shaded surface, I

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.240
can't keep it from intersecting
this circle.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.946
And then number five was
R2 minus a segment.

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:18.720
It was not simply connected,
but if I add another

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.250
dimension, it is simply
connected, for the same kind

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.110
of reason that R3 minus
the origin was.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.120
And then number six was
the solid torus.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.820
Which now, it's kind of hard
to see what the solid torus

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.920
looks like.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.520
But we said, there's one curve
that behaves fine, but the

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.630
curve that goes all the way
around the hole shows it's, in

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.360
fact, not simply connected.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.490
So hopefully that was
informative, and

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.140
that's where I'll stop.
