  "title":"3. Double Integrals and Line Integrals in the Plane",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nUnit 3 Introduction This unit starts our study of integration of functions of several variables. To keep the visualization difficulties to a minimum we will only look at functions of two variables. (We will look at functions of three variables in the next unit.)\nOur main objects of study will be two types of integrals:\nDouble integrals, which are integrals over planar regions. Line or path integrals, which are integrals over curves. All integrals can be thought of as a sum, technically a limit of Riemann sums, and these will be no exception. If you make sure you master this simple idea then you will find the applications and proofs involving these integrals to be straightforward.\nWe will conclude the unit by learning Green\u0026rsquo;s theorem which relates the two types of integrals and is a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Along the way we will introduce the concepts of work and two dimensional flux and also two types of derivatives of vector valued functions of two variables, the curl and the divergence.\nPart A: Double Integrals\n» Session 47: Definition of Double Integration\n» Session 48: Examples of Double Integration\n» Session 49: Exchanging the Order of Integration\n» Session 50: Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates\n» Session 51: Applications: Mass and Average Value\n» Session 52: Applications: Moment of Inertia\n» Session 53: Change of Variables\n» Session 54: Example: Polar Coordinates\n» Session 55: Example\n» Problem Set 7\nPart B: Vector Fields and Line Integrals\n» Session 56: Vector Fields\n» Session 57: Work and Line Integrals\n» Session 58: Geometric Approach\n» Session 59: Example: Line Integrals for Work\n» Session 60: Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals\n» Session 61: Conservative Fields, Path Independence, Exact Differentials\n» Session 62: Gradient Fields\n» Session 63: Potential Functions\n» Session 64: Curl\n» Problem Set 8\nPart C: Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem\n» Session 65: Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem\n» Session 66: Curl(F) = 0 Implies Conservative\n» Session 67: Proof of Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem\n» Session 68: Planimeter: Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem and Area\n» Session 69: Flux in 2D\n» Session 70: Normal Form of Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem\n» Session 71: Extended Green\u0026rsquo;s Theorem: Boundaries with Multiple Pieces\n» Session 72: Simply Connected Regions and Conservative\n» Problem Set 9\nExam 3\n» Practice Exam\n» Session 73: Exam Review\n» Exam\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
