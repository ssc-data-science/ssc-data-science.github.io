  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nA vector field attaches a vector to each point. For example, the sun has a gravitational field, which gives its gravitational attraction at each point in space. The field does work as it moves a mass along a curve. We will learn to express this work as a line integral and to compute its value.\nIn physics, some force fields conserve energy. Such conservative fields are determined by their potential energy functions. We will define what a conservative field is mathematically and learn to identify them and find their potential function.\n» Session 56: Vector Fields\n» Session 57: Work and Line Integrals\n» Session 58: Geometric Approach\n» Session 59: Example: Line Integrals for Work\n» Session 60: Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals\n» Session 61: Conservative Fields, Path Independence, Exact Differentials\n» Session 62: Gradient Fields\n» Session 63: Potential Functions\n» Session 64: Curl\n» Problem Set 8\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
