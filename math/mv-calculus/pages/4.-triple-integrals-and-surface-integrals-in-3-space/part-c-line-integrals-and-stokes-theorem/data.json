  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nIn this part we will extend Green\u0026rsquo;s theorem in work form to Stokes\u0026rsquo; theorem. For a given vector field, this relates the field\u0026rsquo;s work integral over a closed space curve with the flux integral of the field\u0026rsquo;s curl over any surface that has that curve as its boundary.\n» Session 88: Line Integrals in Space\n» Session 89: Gradient Fields and Potential Functions\n» Session 90: Curl in 3D\n» Session 91: Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem\n» Session 92: Proof of Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem\n» Session 93: Example\n» Session 94: Simply Connected Regions; Topology\n» Session 95: Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem and Surface Independence\n» Session 96: Summary of Multiple Integration\n» Problem Set 12\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
