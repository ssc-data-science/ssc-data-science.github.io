  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nHere we will extend Green\u0026rsquo;s theorem in flux form to the divergence (or Gauss\u0026rsquo;) theorem relating the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to a triple integral over the region it encloses. Before learning this theorem we will have to discuss the surface integrals, flux through a surface and the divergence of a vector field.\n» Session 79: Vector Fields in Space\n» Session 80: Flux Through a Surface\n» Session 81: Calculating Flux; Finding ndS\n» Session 82: ndS for a Surface z = f(x, y)\n» Session 83: Other Ways to Find ndS\n» Session 84: Divergence Theorem\n» Session 85: Physical Meaning of Flux; Del Notation\n» Session 86: Proof of the Divergence Theorem\n» Session 87: Diffusion Equation\n» Problem Set 11\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
