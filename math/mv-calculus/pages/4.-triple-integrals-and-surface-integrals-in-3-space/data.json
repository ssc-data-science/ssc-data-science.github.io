  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nUnit 4 Introduction In our last unit we move up from two to three dimensions. Now we will have three main objects of study:\nTriple integrals over solid regions of space. Surface integrals over a 2D surface in space. Line integrals over a curve in space. As before, the integrals can be thought of as sums and we will use this idea in applications and proofs.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll see that there are analogs for both forms of Green\u0026rsquo;s theorem. The work form will become Stokes\u0026rsquo; theorem and the flux form will become the divergence theorem (also known as Gauss\u0026rsquo; theorem). To state these theorems we will need to learn the 3D versions of div and curl.\nPart A: Triple Integrals\n» Session 74: Triple Integrals: Rectangular and Cylindrical Coordinates\n» Session 75: Applications and Examples\n» Session 76: Spherical Coordinates\n» Session 77: Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates\n» Session 78: Applications: Gravitational Attraction\n» Problem Set 10\nPart B: Flux and the Divergence Theorem\n» Session 79: Vector Fields in Space\n» Session 80: Flux Through a Surface\n» Session 81: Calculating Flux; Finding ndS\n» Session 82: ndS for a Surface z = f(x, y)\n» Session 83: Other Ways to Find ndS\n» Session 84: Divergence Theorem\n» Session 85: Physical Meaning of Flux; Del Notation\n» Session 86: Proof of the Divergence Theorem\n» Session 87: Diffusion Equation\n» Problem Set 11\nPart C: Line Integrals and Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem\n» Session 88: Line Integrals in Space\n» Session 89: Gradient Fields and Potential Functions\n» Session 90: Curl in 3D\n» Session 91: Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem\n» Session 92: Proof of Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem\n» Session 93: Example\n» Session 94: Simply Connected Regions; Topology\n» Session 95: Stokes\u0026rsquo; Theorem and Surface Independence\n» Session 96: Summary of Multiple Integration\n» Problem Set 12\nExam 4\n» Practice Exam\n» Exam\nPhysics Applications\n» Session 97: Curl and Physics\n» Session 98: Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s Equations\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
