  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nThe basic point of this part is to formulate systems of linear equations in terms of matrices. We can then view them as analogous to an equation like 7_x_ = 5.\nIn order to use them in systems of equations we will need to learn the algebra of matrices; in particular, how to multiply them and how to find their inverses.\nGeometrically, a linear equation in x, y and z is the equation of a plane. Solving a system of linear equations is equivalent to finding the intersection of the corresponding planes.\n» Session 9: Matrix Multiplication\n» Session 10: Meaning of Matrix Multiplication\n» Session 11: Matrix Inverses\n» Session 12: Equations of Planes II\n» Session 13: Linear Systems and Planes\n» Session 14: Solutions to Square Systems\n» Problem Set 2\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
