  "content":"Next »\nVectors are basic to this course. We will learn to manipulate them algebraically and geometrically. They will help us simplify the statements of problems and theorems and to find solutions and proofs.\nDeterminants measure volumes and areas. They will also be important in part B when we use matrices to solve systems of equations.\n» Session 1: Vectors\n» Session 2: Dot Products\n» Session 3: Uses of the Dot Product: Lengths and Angles\n» Session 4: Vector Components\n» Session 5: Area and Determinants in 2D\n» Session 6: Volumes and Determinants in Space\n» Session 7: Cross Products\n» Session 8: Equations of Planes\n» Problem Set 1\nNext »\n"}
