  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nParametric equations define trajectories in space or in the plane. Very often we can think of the trajectory as that of a particle moving through space and the parameter as time. In this case, the parametric curve is written (x(t); y(t); z(t)), which gives the position of the particle at time t.\nA moving particle also has a velocity and acceleration. These are vectors which vary in time. We will learn to compute them as derivatives of the position vector.\n» Session 15: Equations of Lines\n» Session 16: Intersection of a Line and a Plane\n» Session 17: General Parametric Equations; the Cycloid\n» Session 18: Point (Cusp) on Cycloid\n» Session 19: Velocity and Acceleration\n» Session 20: Velocity and Arc Length\n» Session 21: Kepler\u0026rsquo;s Second Law\n» Problem Set 3\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
