  "title":"1. Vectors and Matrices",
  "content":"Next »\nThis unit covers the basic concepts and language we will use throughout the course. Just like every other topic we cover, we can view vectors and matrices algebraically and geometrically. It is important that you learn both viewpoints and the relationship between them.\nPart A: Vectors, Determinants, and Planes\n» Session 1: Vectors\n» Session 2: Dot Products\n» Session 3: Uses of the Dot Product: Lengths and Angles\n» Session 4: Vector Components\n» Session 5: Area and Determinants in 2D\n» Session 6: Volumes and Determinants in Space\n» Session 7: Cross Products\n» Session 8: Equations of Planes\n» Problem Set 1\nPart B: Matrices and Systems of Equations\n» Session 9: Matrix Multiplication\n» Session 10: Meaning of Matrix Multiplication\n» Session 11: Matrix Inverses\n» Session 12: Equations of Planes II\n» Session 13: Linear Systems and Planes\n» Session 14: Solutions to Square Systems\n» Problem Set 2\nPart C: Parametric Equations for Curves\n» Session 15: Equations of Lines\n» Session 16: Intersection of a Line and a Plane\n» Session 17: General Parametric Equations; the Cycloid\n» Session 18: Point (Cusp) on Cycloid\n» Session 19: Velocity and Acceleration\n» Session 20: Velocity and Arc Length\n» Session 21: Kepler\u0026rsquo;s Second Law\n» Problem Set 3\nExam 1\n» Practice Exam\n» Session 22: Review of Topics\n» Session 23: Review of Problems\n» Exam\nNext »\n"}
